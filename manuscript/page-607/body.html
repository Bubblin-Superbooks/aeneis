Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,  
With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.  

The warrior god the Latian troops inspir’d,  
New strung their sinews, and their courage fir’d,  
But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:  
Then black despair precipitates their flight.  

When Pandarus beheld his brother kill’d,  
The town with fear and wild confusion fill’d,  
He turns the hinges of the heavy gate  
With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight  
Some happier friends within the walls inclos’d;  
The rest shut out, to certain death expos’d:  
Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,  
T’ admit young Turnus, and include the war! </pre></div> </div>
