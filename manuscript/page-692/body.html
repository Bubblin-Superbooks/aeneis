With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;  
Then both his lifted hands to heav’n he spread;  
Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:  
“What joys, alas! could this frail being give,  
That I have been so covetous to live?  
To see my son, and such a son, resign  
His life, a ransom for preserving mine!  
And am I then preserv’d, and art thou lost?  
How much too dear has that redemption cost!  
’Tis now my bitter banishment I feel:  
This is a wound too deep for time to heal.  
My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;  
My blackness blotted thy unblemish’d name.  
Chas’d from a throne, abandon’d, and exil’d  
For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:  
I ow’d my people these, and, from their hate,  
With less resentment could have borne my fate. </pre></div> </div>
