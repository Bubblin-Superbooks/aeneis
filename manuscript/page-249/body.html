Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,  
And ev’ry baleful green denoting death.  
The queen, determin’d to the fatal deed,  
The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,  
And the man’s image on the nuptial bed.  

And now (the sacred altars plac’d around)  
The priestess enters, with her hair unbound,  
And thrice invokes the pow’rs below the ground.  
Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,  
And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,  
And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round  
With feign’d Avernian drops the hallow’d ground;  
Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe’s light,  
With brazen sickles reap’d at noon of night;  
Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,  
And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal, </pre></div> </div>
