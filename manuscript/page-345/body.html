To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray’r;  
And annual rites, and festivals, and games,  
Shall be perform’d to their auspicious names.  
Nor shalt thou want thy honours in my land;  
For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,  
Preserv’d in shrines; and ev’ry sacred lay,  
Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:  
All shall be treasur’d by a chosen train  
Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.  
But O! commit not thy prophetic mind  
To flitting leaves, the sport of ev’ry wind,  
Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;  
Write not, but, what the pow’rs ordain, relate.”  

Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,  
And lab’ring underneath the pond’rous god,  
The more she strove to shake him from her breast, </pre></div> </div>
