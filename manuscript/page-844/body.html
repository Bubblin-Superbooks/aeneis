As when a fragment, from a mountain torn  
By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,  
Or sapp’d by time, or loosen’d from the roots—  
Prone thro’ the void the rocky ruin shoots,  
Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;  
Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:  
Involv’d alike, they rush to nether ground;  
Stunn’d with the shock they fall, and stunn’d from earth rebound:  
So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,  
Should’ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.  
Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,  
Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,  
And sanguine streams the slipp’ry ground embrue.  
First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,  
He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:  
“Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! </pre></div> </div>
