To raise the piles along the winding strand.  
Their friends convey the dead fun’ral fires;  
Black smould’ring smoke from the green wood expires;  
The light of heav’n is chok’d, and the new day retires.  
Then thrice around the kindled piles they go  
(For ancient custom had ordain’d it so)  
Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;  
And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.  
Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,  
And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.  
Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw  
The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:  
Helms, bits emboss’d, and swords of shining steel;  
One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;  
Some to their fellows their own arms restore:  
The falchions which in luckless fight they bore,  
Their bucklers pierc’d, their darts bestow’d in vain, </pre></div> </div>
