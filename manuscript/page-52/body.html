The lifeless body of his son is sold.  
So sad an object, and so well express’d,  
Drew sighs and groans from the griev’d hero’s breast,  
To see the figure of his lifeless friend,  
And his old sire his helpless hand extend.  
Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,  
Mix’d in the bloody battle on the plain;  
And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,  
His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.  
Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,  
Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:  
In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;  
The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.  
Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,  
Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,  
And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose. </pre></div> </div>
