Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,  
Th’ Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.  
Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,  
Procur’d by Juno’s and Eurystheus’ hate:  
“Thy hands, unconquer’d hero, could subdue  
The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:  
Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,  
Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.  
The triple porter of the Stygian seat,  
With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,  
And, seiz’d with fear, forgot his mangled meat.  
Th’ infernal waters trembled at thy sight;  
Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;  
Not huge Typhoeus, nor th’ unnumber’d snake,  
Increas’d with hissing heads, in Lerna’s lake.  
Hail, Jove’s undoubted son! an added grace  
To heav’n and the great author of thy race! </pre></div> </div>
