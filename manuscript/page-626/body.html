Who shakes heav’n’s axles with his awful nod.  
(When he begins, the silent senate stand  
With rev’rence, list’ning to the dread command:  
The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain;  
And the hush’d waves lie flatted on the main.)  
“Celestials, your attentive ears incline!  
Since,” said the god, “the Trojans must not join  
In wish’d alliance with the Latian line;  
Since endless jarrings and immortal hate  
Tend but to discompose our happy state;  
The war henceforward be resign’d to fate:  
Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;  
Equal and unconcern’d I look on all.  
Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;  
And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.  
Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend;  
And, if she favours those, let those defend: </pre></div> </div>
