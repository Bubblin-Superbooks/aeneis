“With tears I took my last adieu, and said:  
‘Your fortune, happy pair, already made,  
Leaves you no farther wish. My diff’rent state,  
Avoiding one, incurs another fate.  
To you a quiet seat the gods allow:  
You have no shores to search, no seas to plow,  
Nor fields of flying Italy to chase:  
(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!)  
You see another Simois, and enjoy  
The labour of your hands, another Troy,  
With better auspice than her ancient tow’rs,  
And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow’rs.  
If e’er the gods, whom I with vows adore,  
Conduct my steps to Tiber’s happy shore;  
If ever I ascend the Latian throne,  
And build a city I may call my own; </pre></div> </div>
