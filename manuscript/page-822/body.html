This gripes the lance, and with such vigour shakes,  
That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.  
Then with a close embrace he strain’d his son,  
And, kissing thro’ his helmet, thus begun:  
“My son, from my example learn the war,  
In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;  
But happier chance than mine attend thy care!  
This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,  
And crown with honours of the conquer’d field:  
Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth  
To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;  
Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,  
For Hector’s nephew, and Aeneas’ son.”  
He said; and, striding, issued on the plain.  
Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num’rous train,  
Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,  
And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. </pre></div> </div>
