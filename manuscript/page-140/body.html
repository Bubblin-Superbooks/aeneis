And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:  
The spoils which they from ransack’d houses brought,  
And golden bowls from burning altars caught,  
The tables of the gods, the purple vests,  
The people’s treasure, and the pomp of priests.  
A rank of wretched youths, with pinion’d hands,  
And captive matrons, in long order stands.  
Then, with ungovern’d madness, I proclaim,  
Thro’ all the silent street, Creusa’s name:  
Creusa still I call; at length she hears,  
And sudden thro’ the shades of night appears.  
Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,  
But a pale spectre, larger than the life.  
Aghast, astonish’d, and struck dumb with fear,  
I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen’d hair.  
Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief  
‘Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. </pre></div> </div>
