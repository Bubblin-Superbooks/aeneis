Let now your immature dissension cease;  
Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.”  

Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;  
But lovely Venus thus replies at large:  
“O pow’r immense, eternal energy,  
(For to what else protection can we fly?)  
Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare  
In fields, unpunish’d, and insult my care?  
How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train,  
In shining arms, triumphant on the plain?  
Ev’n in their lines and trenches they contend,  
And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:  
The town is fill’d with slaughter, and o’erfloats,  
With a red deluge, their increasing moats.  
Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence,  
Has left a camp expos’d, without defence. </pre></div> </div>
