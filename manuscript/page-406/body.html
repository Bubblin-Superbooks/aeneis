By tigers drawn triumphant in his car,  
From Nisus’ top descending on the plains,  
With curling vines around his purple reins.  
And doubt we yet thro’ dangers to pursue  
The paths of honour, and a crown in view?  
But what’s the man, who from afar appears?  
His head with olive crown’d, his hand a censer bears,  
His hoary beard and holy vestments bring  
His lost idea back: I know the Roman king.  
He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain,  
Call’d from his mean abode a scepter to sustain.  
Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds,  
An active prince, and prone to martial deeds.  
He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare,  
Disus’d to toils, and triumphs of the war.  
By dint of sword his crown he shall increase,  
And scour his armour from the rust of peace. </pre></div> </div>
