Black’ning the fields, and thick’ning thro’ the skies.  
Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:  
“What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?  
Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears  
And pointed darts! the Latian host appears.”  

Thus warn’d, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend  
The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:  
For their wise gen’ral, with foreseeing care,  
Had charg’d them not to tempt the doubtful war,  
Nor, tho’ provok’d, in open fields advance,  
But close within their lines attend their chance.  
Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,  
And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.  
The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:  
A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press’d;  
His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest. </pre></div> </div>
