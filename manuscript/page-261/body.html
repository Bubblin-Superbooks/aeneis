Ghastly she gaz’d, with pain she drew her breath,  
And nature shiver’d at approaching death.  

Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass’d,  
And mounts the fun’ral pile with furious haste;  
Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind  
(Not for so dire an enterprise design’d).  
But when she view’d the garments loosely spread,  
Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,  
She paus’d, and with a sigh the robes embrac’d;  
Then on the couch her trembling body cast,  
Repress’d the ready tears, and spoke her last:  
“Dear pledges of my love, while Heav’n so pleas’d,  
Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas’d:  
My fatal course is finish’d; and I go,  
A glorious name, among the ghosts below.  
A lofty city by my hands is rais’d, </pre></div> </div>
