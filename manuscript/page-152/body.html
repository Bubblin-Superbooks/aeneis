‘Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place  
To the sad relics of the Trojan race;  
A seat secure, a region of their own,  
A lasting empire, and a happier town.  
Where shall we fix? where shall our labours end?  
Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?  
Let not my pray’rs a doubtful answer find;  
But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.’  
Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,  
The laurels, and the lofty hills around;  
And from the tripos rush’d a bellowing sound.  
Prostrate we fell; confess’d the present god,  
Who gave this answer from his dark abode:  
‘Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth  
From which your ancestors derive their birth.  
The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race  
In her old bosom shall again embrace. </pre></div> </div>
