The fate of arms, resolv’d in fight to die:  
‘What hope remains, but what my death must give?  
Can I, without so dear a father, live?  
You term it prudence, what I baseness call:  
Could such a word from such a parent fall?  
If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,  
That nothing should of ruin’d Troy remain,  
And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,  
The way to death is wide, th’ approaches near:  
For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,  
Reeking with Priam’s blood: the wretch who slew  
The son (inhuman) in the father’s view,  
And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.  
O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;  
Your gift was undesir’d, and came too late!  
Did you, for this, unhappy me convey  
Thro’ foes and fires, to see my house a prey? </pre></div> </div>
