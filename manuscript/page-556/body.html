Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,  
And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:  
“These monsters for the Trojans’ fate are meant,  
And are by Jove for black presages sent.  
He takes the cowards’ last relief away;  
For fly they cannot, and, constrain’d to stay,  
Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.  
The liquid half of all the globe is lost;  
Heav’n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.  
Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground  
Which myriads of our martial men surround.  
Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.  
’Twas giv’n to Venus they should cross the seas,  
And land secure upon the Latian plains:  
Their promis’d hour is pass’d, and mine remains.  
’Tis in the fate of Turnus to destroy,  
With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy. </pre></div> </div>
