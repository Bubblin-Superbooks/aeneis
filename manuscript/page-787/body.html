And whate’er price Amata’s honour bears  
Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,  
My sickly mind’s repose, my sinking age’s prop;  
Since on the safety of thy life alone  
Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:  
Refuse me not this one, this only pray’r,  
To waive the combat, and pursue the war.  
Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,  
Think it includes, in thine, Amata’s life.  
I cannot live a slave, or see my throne  
Usurp’d by strangers or a Trojan son.”  

At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;  
A crimson blush her beauteous face o’erspread,  
Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.  
The driving colours, never at a stay,  
Run here and there, and flush, and fade away. </pre></div> </div>
