The queen produc’d young Paris to his sire:  
But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,  
Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.  

And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,  
With forest mast and fatt’ning marshes fed,  
When once he sees himself in toils inclos’d,  
By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos’d,  
He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;  
Th’ invaders dart their jav’lins from afar:  
All keep aloof, and safely shout around;  
But none presumes to give a nearer wound:  
He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,  
And shakes a grove of lances from his side:  
Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir’d,  
And just revenge against the tyrant fir’d,  
Their darts with clamour at a distance drive, </pre></div> </div>
