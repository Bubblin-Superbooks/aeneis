Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,  
He took in fight, and living victims led,  
To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,  
In sacrifice, before his fun’ral fire.  
At Magus next he threw: he stoop’d below  
The flying spear, and shunn’d the promis’d blow;  
Then, creeping, clasp’d the hero’s knees, and pray’d:  
“By young Iulus, by thy father’s shade,  
O spare my life, and send me back to see  
My longing sire, and tender progeny!  
A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,  
In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:  
All these, and sums besides, which see no day,  
The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.  
If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?  
A single soul’s too light to turn the scale.” </pre></div> </div>
