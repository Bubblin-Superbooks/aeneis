Your common gift shall two large goblets be  
Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,  
And high emboss’d, which, when old Priam reign’d,  
My conqu’ring sire at sack’d Arisba gain’d;  
And more, two tripods cast in antique mould,  
With two great talents of the finest gold;  
Beside a costly bowl, ingrav’d with art,  
Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.  
But, if in conquer’d Italy we reign,  
When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain—  
Thou saw’st the courser by proud Turnus press’d:  
That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,  
And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:  
Twelve lab’ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair  
All clad in rich attire, and train’d with care;  
And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, </pre></div> </div>
