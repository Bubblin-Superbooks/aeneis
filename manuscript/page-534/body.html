Incompass’d round with gloomy hills above,  
Which add a holy horror to the grove.  
The first inhabitants of Grecian blood,  
That sacred forest to Silvanus vow’d,  
The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay  
Their due devotions on his annual day.  
Not far from hence, along the river’s side,  
In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,  
By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,  
Aeneas cast his wond’ring eyes around,  
And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,  
Stretch’d on the spacious plain from left to right.  
Thither his warlike train the Trojan led,  
Refresh’d his men, and wearied horses fed.  

Meantime the mother goddess, crown’d with charms,  
Breaks thro’ the clouds, and brings the fated arms. </pre></div> </div>
