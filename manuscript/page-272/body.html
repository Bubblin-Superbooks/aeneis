This would I celebrate with annual games,  
With gifts on altars pil’d, and holy flames,  
Tho’ banish’d to Gaetulia’s barren sands,  
Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:  
But since this happy storm our fleet has driv’n  
(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav’n)  
Upon these friendly shores and flow’ry plains,  
Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,  
Let us with joy perform his honours due,  
And pray for prosp’rous winds, our voyage to renew;  
Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,  
The name of great Anchises may be known,  
And yearly games may spread the gods’ renown.  
Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,  
With royal gifts ordain’d, is pleas’d to grace:  
Two steers on ev’ry ship the king bestows;  
His gods and ours shall share your equal vows. </pre></div> </div>
