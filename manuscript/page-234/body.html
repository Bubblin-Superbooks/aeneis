Nor can my mind forget Eliza’s name,  
While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.  
This only let me speak in my defence:  
I never hop’d a secret flight from hence,  
Much less pretended to the lawful claim  
Of sacred nuptials, or a husband’s name.  
For, if indulgent Heav’n would leave me free,  
And not submit my life to fate’s decree,  
My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,  
Those relics to review, their dust adore,  
And Priam’s ruin’d palace to restore.  
But now the Delphian oracle commands,  
And fate invites me to the Latian lands.  
That is the promis’d place to which I steer,  
And all my vows are terminated there.  
If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,  
With walls and tow’rs a Libyan town adorn, </pre></div> </div>
