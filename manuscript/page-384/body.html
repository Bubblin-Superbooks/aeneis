Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;  
And, press’d betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds  
Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais’d on high  
With adamantine columns, threats the sky.  
Vain is the force of man, and Heav’n’s as vain,  
To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.  
Sublime on these a tow’r of steel is rear’d;  
And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,  
Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,  
Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.  
From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains  
Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.  
The Trojan stood astonish’d at their cries,  
And ask’d his guide from whence those yells arise;  
And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,  
And loud laments that rent the liquid air. </pre></div> </div>
