They seize a fleet, which ready rigg’d they find;  
Nor is Pygmalion’s treasure left behind.  
The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea  
With prosp’rous winds; a woman leads the way.  
I know not, if by stress of weather driv’n,  
Or was their fatal course dispos’d by Heav’n;  
At last they landed, where from far your eyes  
May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;  
There bought a space of ground, which Byrsa call’d,  
From the bull’s hide, they first inclos’d, and wall’d.  
But whence are you? what country claims your birth?  
What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?”  

To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,  
And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:  
“Could you with patience hear, or I relate,  
O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate! </pre></div> </div>
