There a Massylian priestess I have found,  
Honour’d for age, for magic arts renown’d:  
Th’ Hesperian temple was her trusted care;  
’Twas she supplied the wakeful dragon’s fare.  
She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,  
Reclaim’d his rage, and sooth’d him into sleep.  
She watch’d the golden fruit; her charms unbind  
The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:  
She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,  
Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.  
The yawning earth rebellows to her call,  
Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.  
Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,  
How loth I am to try this impious art!  
Within the secret court, with silent care,  
Erect a lofty pile, expos’d in air:  
Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest, </pre></div> </div>
