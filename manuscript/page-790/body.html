He sheath’d his limbs in arms; a temper’d mass  
Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.  
Then to his head his glitt’ring helm he tied,  
And girt his faithful falchion to his side.  
In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire  
That falchion labour’d for the hero’s sire;  
Immortal keenness on the blade bestow’d,  
And plung’d it hissing in the Stygian flood.  
Propp’d on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,  
Was plac’d the lance Auruncan Actor wore;  
Which with such force he brandish’d in his hand,  
The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:  
Then cried: “O pond’rous spoil of Actor slain,  
And never yet by Turnus toss’d in vain,  
Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,  
Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe! </pre></div> </div>
