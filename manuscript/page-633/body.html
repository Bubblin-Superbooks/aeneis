Proud of his manag’d horse and painted shield.  
Gravisca, noisome from the neighb’ring fen,  
And his own Caere, sent three hundred men;  
With those which Minio’s fields and Pyrgi gave,  
All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.  

Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew,  
And brave Cupavo follow’d but by few;  
Whose helm confess’d the lineage of the man,  
And bore, with wings display’d, a silver swan.  
Love was the fault of his fam’d ancestry,  
Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly.  
For Cycnus lov’d unhappy Phaeton,  
And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone,  
Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief.  
Heav’n heard his song, and hasten’d his relief,  
And chang’d to snowy plumes his hoary hair, </pre></div> </div>
