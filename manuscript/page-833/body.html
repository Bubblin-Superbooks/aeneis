To leave th’ unfinish’d fight, and storm the town:  
For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain  
In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,  
He views th’ unguarded city from afar,  
In careless quiet, and secure of war.  
Occasion offers, and excites his mind  
To dare beyond the task he first design’d.  
Resolv’d, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:  
Attended thus, he takes a neighb’ring height;  
The crowding troops about their gen’ral stand,  
All under arms, and wait his high command.  
Then thus the lofty prince: “Hear and obey,  
Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay  
Jove is with us; and what I have decreed  
Requires our utmost vigour, and our speed.  
Your instant arms against the town prepare,  
The source of mischief, and the seat of war. </pre></div> </div>
