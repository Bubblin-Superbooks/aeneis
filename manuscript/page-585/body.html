Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;  
They line their trenches, and they man their walls.  
In front extended to the left they stood;  
Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.  
But, casting from their tow’rs a frightful view,  
They saw the faces, which too well they knew,  
Tho’ then disguis’d in death, and smear’d all o’er  
With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.

The mournful message to the mother’s ears.  
An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;  
Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.  
She runs the rampires round amidst the war,  
Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,  
And fills with loud laments the liquid air.  
“Thus, then, my lov’d Euryalus appears! </pre></div> </div>
