With more and far superior force he press’d;  
Commands his entrance, and, without control,  
Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.  
Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors  
Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars  
Within the cave, and Sibyl’s voice restores:  
“Escap’d the dangers of the wat’ry reign,  
Yet more and greater ills by land remain.  
The coast, so long desir’d (nor doubt th’ event),  
Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach’d, repent.  
Wars, horrid wars, I view; a field of blood,  
And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.  
Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:  
A new Achilles shall in arms appear,  
And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno’s hate,  
Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.  
To what strange nations shalt not thou resort, </pre></div> </div>
