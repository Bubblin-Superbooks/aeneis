Or weary sate, or wander’d with affright;  
But she was lost for ever to my sight.  
I knew not, or reflected, till I meet  
My friends, at Ceres’ now deserted seat.  
We met: not one was wanting; only she  
Deceiv’d her friends, her son, and wretched me.  

“What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!  
Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!  
This was the fatal blow, that pain’d me more  
Than all I felt from ruin’d Troy before.  
Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,  
Abandoning my now forgotten care,  
Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,  
My sire, my son, my country gods I left.  
In shining armour once again I sheathe  
My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death. </pre></div> </div>
