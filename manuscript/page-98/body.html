A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join  
T’ invade the town, oppress’d with sleep and wine.  
Those few they find awake first meet their fate;  
Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.  

“’Twas in the dead of night, when sleep repairs  
Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,  
When Hector’s ghost before my sight appears:  
A bloody shroud he seem’d, and bath’d in tears;  
Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,  
Thessalian coursers dragg’d him o’er the plain.  
Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust  
Thro’ the bor’d holes; his body black with dust;  
Unlike that Hector who return’d from toils  
Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,  
Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,  
And launch’d against their navy Phrygian fire. </pre></div> </div>
