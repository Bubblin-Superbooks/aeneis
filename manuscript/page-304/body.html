And, like a captain who beleaguers round  
Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,  
Views all th’ approaches with observing eyes:  
This and that other part in vain he tries,  
And more on industry than force relies.  
With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;  
But Dares watch’d the motion from below,  
And slipp’d aside, and shunn’d the long descending blow.  
Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,  
And, thus deluded of the stroke design’d,  
Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast  
And weighty limbs his ancient mother press’d.  
So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood  
On Ida’s height, or Erymanthus’ wood,  
Torn from the roots. The diff’ring nations rise,  
And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies, </pre></div> </div>
