Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,  
And either hand a pointed jav’lin bore.  
His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;  
His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.  
He welcomes his returning friends ashore  
With plenteous country cates and homely store.  

Now, when the following morn had chas’d away  
The flying stars, and light restor’d the day,  
Aeneas call’d the Trojan troops around,  
And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:  
“Offspring of heav’n, divine Dardanian race!  
The sun, revolving thro’ th’ ethereal space,  
The shining circle of the year has fill’d,  
Since first this isle my father’s ashes held:  
And now the rising day renews the year;  
A day for ever sad, for ever dear. </pre></div> </div>
