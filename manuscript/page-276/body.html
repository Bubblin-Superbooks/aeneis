The bord’ring people, rous’d by sounding fame  
Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes’ name,  
The crowded shore with acclamations fill,  
Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.  
And first the gifts in public view they place,  
Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors’ grace: </pre></div> </div>
