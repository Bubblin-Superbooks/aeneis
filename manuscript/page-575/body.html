Nor with less rage Euryalus employs  
The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;  
But on th’ ignoble crowd his fury flew;  
He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.  
Oppress’d with heavy sleep the former fell,  
But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:  
Behind a spacious jar he slink’d for fear;  
The fatal iron found and reach’d him there;  
For, as he rose, it pierc’d his naked side,  
And, reeking, thence return’d in crimson dyed.  
The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;  
The purple soul comes floating in the flood.  

Now, where Messapus quarter’d, they arrive.  
The fires were fainting there, and just alive;  
The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed. </pre></div> </div>
