The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home  
With standards well redeem’d, and foreign foes o’ercome  
The pair you see in equal armour shine,  
Now, friends below, in close embraces join;  
But, when they leave the shady realms of night,  
And, cloth’d in bodies, breathe your upper light,  
With mortal hate each other shall pursue:  
What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue!  
From Alpine heights the father first descends;  
His daughter’s husband in the plain attends:  
His daughter’s husband arms his eastern friends.  
Embrace again, my sons, be foes no more;  
Nor stain your country with her children’s gore!  
And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim,  
Thou, of my blood, who bear’st the Julian name!  
Another comes, who shall in triumph ride, </pre></div> </div>
