And Helen’s lovely daughter sought to wed;  
Then me to Trojan Helenus resign’d,  
And his two slaves in equal marriage join’d;  
Till young Orestes, pierc’d with deep despair,  
And longing to redeem the promis’d fair,  
Before Apollo’s altar slew the ravisher.  
By Pyrrhus’ death the kingdom we regain’d:  
At least one half with Helenus remain’d.  
Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,  
And names from Pergamus his rising walls.  
But you, what fates have landed on our coast?  
What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss’d?  
Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,  
Sav’d from the ruins of unhappy Troy?  
O tell me how his mother’s loss he bears,  
What hopes are promis’d from his blooming years,  
How much of Hector in his face appears?’ </pre></div> </div>
