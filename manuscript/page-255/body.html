A god commands: he stood before my sight,  
And urg’d us once again to speedy flight.  
O sacred pow’r, what pow’r soe’er thou art,  
To thy blest orders I resign my heart.  
Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,  
And prosper the design thy will commands.”  
He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,  
His thund’ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.  
An emulating zeal inspires his train:  
They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.  
With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,  
And brush the liquid seas with lab’ring oars.  

Aurora now had left her saffron bed,  
And beams of early light the heav’ns o’erspread,  
When, from a tow’r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,  
Saw day point upward from the rosy skies. </pre></div> </div>
