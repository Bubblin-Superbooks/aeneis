“Whether, O coward?” (thus he calls aloud,  
Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas’d a cloud,)  
“Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me  
The fated land you sought so long by sea.”  
He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,  
With eager pace pursued the flying shade.  
By chance a ship was fasten’d to the shore,  
Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:  
The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;  
For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,  
And skipp’t and skulk’d, and under hatches went.  
Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,  
Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass’d.  
Scarce had he reach’d the prow: Saturnia’s hand  
The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.  
With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,  
And measures back with speed her former way. </pre></div> </div>
