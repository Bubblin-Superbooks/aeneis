Unhappy Theseus, doom’d for ever there,  
Is fix’d by fate on his eternal chair;  
And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries  
(Could warning make the world more just or wise):  
‘Learn righteousness, and dread th’ avenging deities.’  
To tyrants others have their country sold,  
Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;  
Some have old laws repeal’d, new statutes made,  
Not as the people pleas’d, but as they paid;  
With incest some their daughters’ bed profan’d:  
All dar’d the worst of ills, and, what they dar’d, attain’d.  
Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,  
And throats of brass, inspir’d with iron lungs,  
I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,  
Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.  
But let us haste our voyage to pursue: </pre></div> </div>
