And make thee father of a happy line.”  

To this the god: “’Tis yours, O queen, to will  
The work which duty binds me to fulfil.  
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,  
Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:  
Yours is my sov’reign’s grace; and, as your guest,  
I sit with gods at their celestial feast;  
Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;  
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.”  

He said, and hurl’d against the mountain side  
His quiv’ring spear, and all the god applied.  
The raging winds rush thro’ the hollow wound,  
And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;  
Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,  
Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep. </pre></div> </div>
