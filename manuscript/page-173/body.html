Then to the royal seer I thus began:  
‘O thou, who know’st, beyond the reach of man,  
The laws of heav’n, and what the stars decree;  
Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,  
From his own tripod, and his holy tree;  
Skill’d in the wing’d inhabitants of air,  
What auspices their notes and flights declare:  
O say; for all religious rites portend  
A happy voyage, and a prosp’rous end;  
And ev’ry power and omen of the sky  
Direct my course for destin’d Italy;  
But only dire Celaeno, from the gods,  
A dismal famine fatally forebodes:  
O say what dangers I am first to shun,  
What toils vanquish, and what course to run.’
