His ministers of wrath, and ready still  
The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,  
Whene’er the moody sire, to wreak his hate  
On realms or towns deserving of their fate,  
Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,  
And terrifies the guilty world with war.

To fright Juturna with a dire portent.  
The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow  
Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,  
Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,  
And drench’d in pois’nous juice, the sure destruction flies.

Shot thro’ the clouds the daughter of the night.

And from afar her destin’d quarry knew, </pre></div> </div>
