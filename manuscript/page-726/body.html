Such arms this hand shall never more employ;  
No hate remains with me to ruin’d Troy.  
I war not with its dust; nor am I glad  
To think of past events, or good or bad.  
Your presents I return: whate’er you bring  
To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.  
We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:  
With what a whirling force his lance he toss’d!  
Heav’ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!  
How high he held his shield, and rose at ev’ry blow!  
Had Troy produc’d two more his match in might,  
They would have chang’d the fortune of the fight:  
Th’ invasion of the Greeks had been return’d,  
Our empire wasted, and our cities burn’d.  
The long defence the Trojan people made,  
The war protracted, and the siege delay’d,  
Were due to Hector’s and this hero’s hand: </pre></div> </div>
