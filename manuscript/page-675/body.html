Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,  
And sends his slaughter’d troops to shades below.  

The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,  
And flew sublime, and vanish’d in a cloud.  
Too late young Turnus the delusion found,  
Far on the sea, still making from the ground.  
Then, thankless for a life redeem’d by shame,  
With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame,  
Fearful besides of what in fight had pass’d,  
His hands and haggard eyes to heav’n he cast;  
“O Jove!” he cried, “for what offence have I  
Deserv’d to bear this endless infamy?  
Whence am I forc’d, and whether am I borne?  
How, and with what reproach, shall I return?  
Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,  
Or see Laurentum’s lofty tow’rs again? </pre></div> </div>
