Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn  
Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,  
That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:  
Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat’ry race;  
Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,  
And others try the twanging bow to bend;  
The strong, with iron gauntlets arm’d, shall stand  
Oppos’d in combat on the yellow sand.  
Let all be present at the games prepar’d,  
And joyful victors wait the just reward.  
But now assist the rites, with garlands crown’d.”  
He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.  
Then Helymus, by his example led,  
And old Acestes, each adorn’d his head;  
Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,  
His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. </pre></div> </div>
