Deriv’d from Pallas, his great-grandsire’s name:  
But the fierce Latians old possession claim,  
With war infesting the new colony.  
These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.  
To thy free passage I submit my streams.  
Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;  
And, when the setting stars are lost in day,  
To Juno’s pow’r thy just devotion pay;  
With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:  
Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.  
When thou return’st victorious from the war,  
Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.  
The god am I, whose yellow water flows  
Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:  
Tiber my name; among the rolling floods  
Renown’d on earth, esteem’d among the gods.  
This is my certain seat. In times to come, </pre></div> </div>
