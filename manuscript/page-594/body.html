Then rushing onward with a barb’rous cry,  
The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.  
The ditch with fagots fill’d, the daring foe  
Toss’d firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.  

Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came  
To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame,  
Roll’d down the fragment of a rock so right,  
It crush’d him double underneath the weight.  
Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:  
To bend the bow young Liger better knew;  
Asylas best the pointed jav’lin threw.  
Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;  
The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.  
By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall,  
Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall. </pre></div> </div>
