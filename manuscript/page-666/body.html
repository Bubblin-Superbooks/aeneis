They fled for fear; with these, he chas’d along  
Camers the yellow-lock’d, and Numa strong;  
Both great in arms, and both were fair and young.  
Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,  
In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,  
And in Amycla fix’d his silent easy reign.  
And, as Aegaeon, when with heav’n he strove,  
Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;  
Mov’d all his hundred hands, provok’d the war,  
Defied the forky lightning from afar;  
At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,  
And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;  
In his right hand as many swords he wields,  
And takes the thunder on as many shields:  
With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;  
And soon the fields with falling corps were strow’d,  
When once his falchion found the taste of blood. </pre></div> </div>
