The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,  
Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:  
Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,  
With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,  
That drove the sand along, he took his way,  
And roll’d his yellow billows to the sea.  
About him, and above, and round the wood,  
The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,  
That bath’d within, or basked upon his side,  
To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.  
The captain gives command; the joyful train  
Glide thro’ the gloomy shade, and leave the main.  

Now, Erato, thy poet’s mind inspire,  
And fill his soul with thy celestial fire!  
Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;  
Declare the past and present state of things, </pre></div> </div>
