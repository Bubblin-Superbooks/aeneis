Ev’n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;  
Still vanquish’d, yet she still renews the strife.  
As if ’twere little to consume the town  
Which aw’d the world, and wore th’ imperial crown,  
She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,  
And gnaws, ev’n to the bones, the last remains.  
Let her the causes of her hatred tell;  
But you can witness its effects too well.  
You saw the storm she rais’d on Libyan floods,  
That mix’d the mounting billows with the clouds;  
When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,  
And mov’d rebellion in your wat’ry reign.  
With fury she possess’d the Dardan dames,  
To burn their fleet with execrable flames,  
And forc’d Aeneas, when his ships were lost,  
To leave his foll’wers on a foreign coast.  
For what remains, your godhead I implore, </pre></div> </div>
