Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?  
See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?  
Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,  
By this right hand, (since I have nothing more  
To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)  
I beg you by these tears too truly shed,  
By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;  
If ever Dido, when you most were kind,  
Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch’d your mind;  
By these my pray’rs, if pray’rs may yet have place,  
Pity the fortunes of a falling race.  
For you I have provok’d a tyrant’s hate,  
Incens’d the Libyan and the Tyrian state;  
For you alone I suffer in my fame,  
Bereft of honour, and expos’d to shame.  
Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?  
(That only name remains of all the rest!) </pre></div> </div>
