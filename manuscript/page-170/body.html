What have you suffer’d since you lost your lord?  
By what strange blessing are you now restor’d?  
Still are you Hector’s? or is Hector fled,  
And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus’ bed?’  
With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,  
After a modest pause she thus begun:

Whom death deliver’d from the foes’ embrace!  
Commanded on Achilles’ tomb to die,  
Not forc’d, like us, to hard captivity,  
Or in a haughty master’s arms to lie.  
In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,  
Endur’d the victor’s lust, sustain’d the scorn:  
Thus I submitted to the lawless pride  
Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.  
Cloy’d with possession, he forsook my bed, </pre></div> </div>
