And then revolv’d what Faunus had divin’d.  
This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed  
To share his scepter, and Lavinia’s bed;  
This was the race that sure portents foreshew  
To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.  
At length he rais’d his cheerful head, and spoke:  
“The pow’rs,” said he, “the pow’rs we both invoke,  
To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,  
And firm our purpose with their augury!  
Have what you ask; your presents I receive;  
Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;  
Partake and use my kingdom as your own;  
All shall be yours, while I command the crown:  
And, if my wish’d alliance please your king,  
Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.  
Then let him not a friend’s embraces fear;  
The peace is made when I behold him here. </pre></div> </div>
