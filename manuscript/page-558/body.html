Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.  
Let them not fear the treasons of the night,  
The robb’d Palladium, the pretended flight:  
Our onset shall be made in open light.  
No wooden engine shall their town betray;  
Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.  
No Grecian babes before their camp appear,  
Whom Hector’s arms detain’d to the tenth tardy year.  
Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,  
Give we the silent night to needful rest:  
Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;  
The morn shall end the small remains of war.”  

The post of honour to Messapus falls,  
To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,  
To pitch the fires at distances around,  
And close the Trojans in their scanty ground. </pre></div> </div>
