At her approach the brazen hinges fly;  
The gates are forc’d, and ev’ry falling bar;  
And, like a tempest, issues out the war.  

The peaceful cities of th’ Ausonian shore,  
Lull’d in their ease, and undisturb’d before,  
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,  
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;  
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,  
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen’ral cry.  
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part  
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:  
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,  
And hear the trumpet’s clangour pierce the sky.  
Five cities forge their arms: th’ Atinian pow’rs,  
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow’rs,  
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town: </pre></div> </div>
