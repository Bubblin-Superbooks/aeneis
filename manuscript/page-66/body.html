Of curious work, where on the sides were seen  
The fights and figures of illustrious men,  
From their first founder to the present queen.  

The good Aeneas, whose paternal care  
Iulus’ absence could no longer bear,  
Dispatch’d Achates to the ships in haste,  
To give a glad relation of the past,  
And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,  
Snatch’d from the ruins of unhappy Troy:  
A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;  
An upper vest, once Helen’s rich attire,  
From Argos by the fam’d adultress brought,  
With golden flow’rs and winding foliage wrought,  
Her mother Leda’s present, when she came  
To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;  
The scepter Priam’s eldest daughter bore, </pre></div> </div>
