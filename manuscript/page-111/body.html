Then, mov’d with anger and disdain, to see  
Their troops dispers’d, the royal virgin free,  
The Grecians rally, and their pow’rs unite,  
With fury charge us, and renew the fight.  
The brother kings with Ajax join their force,  
And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.  

“Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,  
Contending for the kingdom of the sky,  
South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;  
The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:  
Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,  
And, mix’d with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.  
The troops we squander’d first again appear  
From several quarters, and enclose the rear.  
They first observe, and to the rest betray,  
Our diff’rent speech; our borrow’d arms survey. </pre></div> </div>
