A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,  
Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,  
Butts with his threat’ning brows, and bellowing stands,  
And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.”  

Jove bow’d the heav’ns, and lent a gracious ear,  
And thunder’d on the left, amidst the clear.  
Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies  
The feather’d death, and hisses thro’ the skies.  
The steel thro’ both his temples forc’d the way:  
Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.  
“Go now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn!  
The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.”  
Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake  
The heav’ns with shouting, and new vigour take. </pre></div> </div>
