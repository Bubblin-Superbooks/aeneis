Of his left foot, and spurn’d the wretched corse;  
Then snatch’d the shining belt, with gold inlaid;  
The belt Eurytion’s artful hands had made,  
Where fifty fatal brides, express’d to sight,  
All in the compass of one mournful night,  
Depriv’d their bridegrooms of returning light.  

In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore  
Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.  
O mortals, blind in fate, who never know  
To bear high fortune, or endure the low!  
The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,  
Shall wish untouch’d the trophies of the slain;  
Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,  
And curse the dire remembrance of the day.
