And thus the tenor of her suit express’d:  

“O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav’n  
The pow’r of tempests and of winds has giv’n;  
Thy force alone their fury can restrain,  
And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main.  
A race of wand’ring slaves, abhorr’d by me,  
With prosp’rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;  
To fruitful Italy their course they steer,  
And for their vanquish’d gods design new temples there.  
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;  
Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.  
Twice sev’n, the charming daughters of the main,  
Around my person wait, and bear my train:  
Succeed my wish, and second my design;  
The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, </pre></div> </div>
