Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,  
How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;  
But he, not mindless of his mother’s pray’r,  
Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,  
And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care.  
The dead is to the living love resign’d;  
And all Aeneas enters in her mind.  

Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas’d,  
The meat remov’d, and ev’ry guest was pleas’d,  
The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown’d,  
And thro’ the palace cheerful cries resound.  
From gilded roofs depending lamps display  
Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.  
A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,  
The queen commanded to be crown’d with wine:  
The bowl that Belus us’d, and all the Tyrian line. </pre></div> </div>
