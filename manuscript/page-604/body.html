And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,  
And waving crests above their heads appear.  
Thus two tall oaks, that Padus’ banks adorn,  
Lift up to heav’n their leafy heads unshorn,  
And, overpress’d with nature’s heavy load,  
Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod.  
In flows a tide of Latians, when they see  
The gate set open, and the passage free;  
Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,  
Equicolus, that in bright armour shone,  
And Haemon first; but soon repuls’d they fly,  
Or in the well-defended pass they die.  
These with success are fir’d, and those with rage,  
And each on equal terms at length engage.  
Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,  
The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. </pre></div> </div>
