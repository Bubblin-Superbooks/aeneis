And fix their pointed lances in the sand.  
Now, studious of the sight, a num’rous throng  
Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,  
Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,  
The gates and walls and houses’ tops are lin’d.  
Meantime the Queen of Heav’n beheld the sight,  
With eyes unpleas’d, from Mount Albano’s height  
(Since call’d Albano by succeeding fame,  
But then an empty hill, without a name).  
She thence survey’d the field, the Trojan pow’rs,  
The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow’rs.  
Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke,  
With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,  
King Turnus’ sister, once a lovely maid,  
Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray’d:  
Compress’d by force, but, by the grateful god,  
Now made the Nais of the neighb’ring flood. </pre></div> </div>
