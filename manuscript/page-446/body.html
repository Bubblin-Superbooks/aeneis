There sought the queen’s apartment, stood before  
The peaceful threshold, and besieg’d the door.  
Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast  
Fir’d with disdain for Turnus dispossess’d,  
And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.  
From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes  
Her darling plague, the fav’rite of her snakes;  
With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,  
And fix’d it deep within Amata’s heart,  
That, thus envenom’d, she might kindle rage,  
And sacrifice to strife her house and husband’s age.  
Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims  
Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;  
His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,  
Now like a chain around her neck he rides,  
Now like a fillet to her head repairs,  
And with his circling volumes folds her hairs. </pre></div> </div>
