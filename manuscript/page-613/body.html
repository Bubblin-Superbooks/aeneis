But with slow paces measures back the field,  
And inches to the walls, where Tiber’s tide,  
Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.

And tread in ev’ry step he trod before.  
They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might  
They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.

The lordly lion still maintains his ground;  
Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;  
Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;  
He loses while in vain he presses on,  
Nor will his courage let him dare to run:  
So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,  
Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.  
Yet twice, enrag’d, the combat he renews, </pre></div> </div>
