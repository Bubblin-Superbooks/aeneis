Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:  
“None of your sisters have we heard or seen,  
O virgin! or what other name you bear  
Above that style; O more than mortal fair!  
Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!  
If, as you seem, the sister of the day,  
Or one at least of chaste Diana’s train,  
Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;  
But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss’d,  
What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?  
Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,  
And offer’d victims at your altars fall.”  
“I dare not,” she replied, “assume the name  
Of goddess, or celestial honours claim:  
For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,  
And purple buskins o’er their ankles wear. </pre></div> </div>
