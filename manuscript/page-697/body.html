His lord’s encumber’d shoulder overlaid.  

From either host, the mingled shouts and cries  
Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.  
Aeneas, hast’ning, wav’d his fatal sword  
High o’er his head, with this reproachful word:  
“Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain  
Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?”  

Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,  
With scarce recover’d sight he thus replies:  
“Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,  
To souls undaunted, and secure of death?  
’Tis no dishonour for the brave to die,  
Nor came I here with hope victory;  
Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:  
As I had us’d my fortune, use thou thine. </pre></div> </div>
