Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew  
In other forms the military shew.  
At last, in order, undiscern’d they join,  
And march together in a friendly line.  
And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,  
With wand’ring ways and many a winding fold,  
Involv’d the weary feet, without redress,  
In a round error, which denied recess;  
So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,  
Turn’d and return’d, and still a diff’rent way.  
Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase  
In circles, when they swim around the wat’ry race.  
This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;  
And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;  
Shew’d what he learn’d: the Latin sires impart  
To their succeeding sons the graceful art;  
From these imperial Rome receiv’d the game, </pre></div> </div>
