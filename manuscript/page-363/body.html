And Briareus with all his hundred hands;  
Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;  
And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.  
The chief unsheath’d his shining steel, prepar’d,  
Tho’ seiz’d with sudden fear, to force the guard,  
Off’ring his brandish’d weapon at their face;  
Had not the Sibyl stopp’d his eager pace,  
And told him what those empty phantoms were:  
Forms without bodies, and impassive air.  
Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,  
Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,  
Are whirl’d aloft, and in Cocytus lost.  
There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast:  
A sordid god: down from his hoary chin  
A length of beard descends, uncomb’d, unclean;  
His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;  
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. </pre></div> </div>
