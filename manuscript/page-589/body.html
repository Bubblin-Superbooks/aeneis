Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;  
Contented now to gall them from below  
With darts and slings, and with the distant bow.  

Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,  
A blazing pine within the trenches threw.  
But brave Messapus, Neptuneâ€™s warlike son,  
Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,  
And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.  

Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,  
Inspire your poet in his high design,  
To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,  
What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,  
What fame the soldiers with their captain share,  
And the vast circuit of the fatal war;  
For you in singing martial facts excel; </pre></div> </div>
