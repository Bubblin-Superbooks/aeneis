Anchises, last, is honour’d as a god;  
A priest is added, annual gifts bestow’d,  
And groves are planted round his blest abode.  
Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown’d;  
And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.  
Then from the south arose a gentle breeze  
That curl’d the smoothness of the glassy seas;  
The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,  
And call the merry mariners aboard.  

Now loud laments along the shores resound,  
Of parting friends in close embraces bound.  
The trembling women, the degenerate train,  
Who shunn’d the frightful dangers of the main,  
Ev’n those desire to sail, and take their share  
Of the rough passage and the promis’d war:  
Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends </pre></div> </div>
