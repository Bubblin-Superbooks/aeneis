Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,  
And honourable wounds from battle brought.  
Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,  
And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,  
And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.  
Above the rest, as chief of all the band,  
Was Picus plac’d, a buckler in his hand;  
His other wav’d a long divining wand.  
Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,  
Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:  
For Circe long had lov’d the youth in vain,  
Till love, refus’d, converted to disdain:  
Then, mixing pow’rful herbs, with magic art,  
She chang’d his form, who could not change his heart;  
Constrain’d him in a bird, and made him fly,  
With party-colour’d plumes, a chatt’ring pie. </pre></div> </div>
