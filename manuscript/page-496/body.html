Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;  
From Atreus tho’ your ancient lineage came,  
And both the brother kings your kindred claim;  
Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,  
Your virtue, thro’ the neighb’ring nations blown,  
Our fathers’ mingled blood, Apollo’s voice,  
Have led me hither, less by need than choice.  
Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,  
And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:  
Electra from the loins of Atlas came;  
Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.  
Your sire is Mercury, whom long before  
On cold Cyllene’s top fair Maia bore.  
Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,  
Was Atlas’ daughter, who sustains the sky.  
Thus from one common source our streams divide;  
Ours is the Trojan, yours th’ Arcadian side. </pre></div> </div>
