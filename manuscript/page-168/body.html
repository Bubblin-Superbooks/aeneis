And skimm’d along Epirus’ rocky coast.  

“Then to Chaonia’s port our course we bend,  
And, landed, to Buthrotus’ heights ascend.  
Here wondrous things were loudly blaz’d fame:  
How Helenus reviv’d the Trojan name,  
And reign’d in Greece; that Priam’s captive son  
Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;  
And fair Andromache, restor’d by fate,  
Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.  
I leave my galleys riding in the port,  
And long to see the new Dardanian court.  
By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,  
Then solemniz’d her former husband’s fate.  
Green altars, rais’d of turf, with gifts she crown’d,  
And sacred priests in order stand around,  
And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. </pre></div> </div>
