And living waters bear, and holy fire;  
And, o’er their linen hoods and shaded hair,  
Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear.

And from the fields, advancing on a line,  
The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:  
Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;  
A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar’d for fight.  
Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,  
Glitt’ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;  
Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,  
And there Messapus, born of seed divine.  
The sign is giv’n; and, round the listed space,  
Each man in order fills his proper place.  
Reclining on their ample shields, they stand, </pre></div> </div>
