Both brave alike, and equal in command;  
Aeneas, not inferior in the field,  
In pious reverence to the gods excell’d.  
Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care  
Th’ impending dangers of a fatal war.’  
He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,  
Refus’d th’ alliance, and advis’d a truce.”

And dashes o’er the stones that stop the course,  
The flood, constrain’d within a scanty space,  
Roars horrible along th’ uneasy race;  
White foam in gath’ring eddies floats around;  
The rocky shores rebellow to the sound. </pre></div> </div>
