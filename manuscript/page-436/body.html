Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,  
Fit to receive and serve our banish’d gods.  
Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,  
Nor length of time our gratitude efface.  
Besides, what endless honour you shall gain,  
To save and shelter Troy’s unhappy train!  
Now, by my sov’reign, and his fate, I swear,  
Renown’d for faith in peace, for force in war;  
Oft our alliance other lands desir’d,  
And, what we seek of you, of us requir’d.  
Despite not then, that in our hands we bear  
These holy boughs, and sue with words of pray’r.  
Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,  
Have doom’d our ships to seek the Latian land.  
To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;  
Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;  
Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force, </pre></div> </div>
