And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.  
Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,  
Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.

And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.

Or your own beauties or my love distrust?

Th’ artificer and art you might command,  
To labour arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,  
Confin’d their empire to so short a date.  
And, if you now desire new wars to wage,  
My skill I promise, and my pains engage.  
Whatever melting metals can conspire, </pre></div> </div>
