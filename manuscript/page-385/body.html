She thus replied: “The chaste and holy race  
Are all forbidden this polluted place.  
But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,  
Then led me trembling thro’ these dire abodes,  
And taught the tortures of th’ avenging gods.  
These are the realms of unrelenting fate;  
And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.  
He hears and judges each committed crime;  
Enquires into the manner, place, and time.  
The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,  
Loth to confess, unable to conceal,  
From the first moment of his vital breath,  
To his last hour of unrepenting death.  
Straight, o’er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes  
The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,  
And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. </pre></div> </div>
