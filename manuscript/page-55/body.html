And where they left their ships, and what their fate,  
And why they came, and what was their request;  
For these were sent, commission’d by the rest,  
To sue for leave to land their sickly men,  
And gain admission to the gracious queen.  
Ent’ring, with cries they fill’d the holy fane;  
Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:  

“O Queen! indulg’d by favour of the gods  
To found an empire in these new abodes,  
To build a town, with statutes to restrain  
The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,  
We wretched Trojans, toss’d on ev’ry shore,  
From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.  
Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!  
Receive th’ unhappy fugitives to grace,  
And spare the remnant of a pious race! </pre></div> </div>
