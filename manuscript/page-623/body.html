To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,  
With walls unfinish’d, which himself forsakes,  
And thro’ the waves a wand’ring voyage takes?  
When have I urg’d him meanly to demand  
The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?  
Did I or Iris give this mad advice,  
Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?  
You think it hard, the Latians should destroy  
With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!  
Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw  
Their native air, nor take a foreign law!  
That Turnus is permitted still to live,  
To whom his birth a god and goddess give!  
But yet is just and lawful for your line  
To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;  
Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,  
And from the bridegroom tear the promis’d bride; </pre></div> </div>
