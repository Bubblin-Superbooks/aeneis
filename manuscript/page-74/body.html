Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.  
The goblet goes around: Iopas brought  
His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:  
The various labours of the wand’ring moon,  
And whence proceed th’ eclipses of the sun;  
Th’ original of men and beasts; and whence  
The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,  
And fix’d and erring stars dispose their influence;  
What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays  
The summer nights and shortens winter days.  
With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:  
Those peals are echo’d by the Trojan throng.  
Th’ unhappy queen with talk prolong’d the night,  
And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;  
Of Priam much enquir’d, of Hector more;  
Then ask’d what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,  
What troops he landed on the Trojan shore; </pre></div> </div>
