And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.  
Trembling he views the thund’ring chief advance,  
And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:

With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.  
Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,  
Or stones from batt’ring-engines break the walls:  
Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,  
The lance drove on, and bore the death along.  
Naught could his sev’nfold shield the prince avail, </pre></div> </div>
