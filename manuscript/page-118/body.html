Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.  
Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood  
Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;  
Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,  
And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.  
These eyes beheld him when he march’d between  
The brother kings: I saw th’ unhappy queen,  
The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,  
To stain his hallow’d altar with his brood.  
The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,  
So large a promise, of a progeny),  
The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,  
Fell the reward of the proud victor’s toils.  
Where’er the raging fire had left a space,  
The Grecians enter and possess the place.  

“Perhaps you may of Priam’s fate enquire. </pre></div> </div>
