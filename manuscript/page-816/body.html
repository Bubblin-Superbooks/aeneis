His crest of horses’ hair is blown behind  
By adverse air, and rustles in the wind.  

This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,  
And, as the chariot roll’d along the plain,  
Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz’d the rein.  
Thus hung in air, he still retain’d his hold,  
The coursers frighted, and their course controll’d.  
The lance of Turnus reach’d him as he hung,  
And pierc’d his plated arms, but pass’d along,  
And only raz’d the skin. He turn’d, and held  
Against his threat’ning foe his ample shield;  
Then call’d for aid: but, while he cried in vain,  
The chariot bore him backward on the plain.  
He lies revers’d; the victor king descends,  
And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,  
He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk </pre></div> </div>
