Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?  
Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?  
Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?  
A wand’ring woman builds, within our state,  
A little town, bought at an easy rate;  
She pays me homage, and my grants allow  
A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;  
Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,  
Admits a banish’d Trojan to her bed!  
And now this other Paris, with his train  
Of conquer’d cowards, must in Afric reign!  
(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,  
Their locks with oil perfum’d, their Lydian dress.)  
He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;  
And I, rejected I, adore an empty name.”  

His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr’d, </pre></div> </div>
