As with an engine’s force, or lightning’s blast:  
He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.  
The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,  
And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight  
Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;  
Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,  
And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;  
Till, seiz’d, with shame, they wheel about and face,  
Receive their foes, and raise a threat’ning cry.  
The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.  
So swelling surges, with a thund’ring roar,  
Driv’n on each other’s backs, insult the shore,  
Bound o’er the rocks, incroach upon the land,  
And far upon the beach eject the sand;  
Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,  
Repuls’d from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;</pre></div> </div>
