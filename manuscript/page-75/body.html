The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,  
And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;  
At length, as fate and her ill stars requir’d,  
To hear the series of the war desir’d.  
“Relate at large, my godlike guest,” she said,  
“The Grecian stratagems, the town betray’d:  
The fatal issue of so long a war,  
Your flight, your wand’rings, and your woes, declare;  
For, since on ev’ry sea, on ev’ry coast,  
Your men have been distress’d, your navy toss’d,  
Sev’n times the sun has either tropic view’d,  
The winter banish’d, and the spring renew’d.”  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
