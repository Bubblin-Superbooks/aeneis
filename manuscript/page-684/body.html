And mourn the miseries of human life.  
Above the rest, two goddesses appear  
Concern’d for each: here Venus, Juno there.  
Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes  
Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.  

Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,  
Brandish’d his spear, and rush’d into the plain,  
Where tow’ring in the midmost rank she stood,  
Like tall Orion stalking o’er the flood.  
(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,  
His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),  
Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,  
Deep fix’d in earth; in clouds he hides his head.  

The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,  
And dauntless undertook the doubtful war. </pre></div> </div>
