And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.  
As when a snake, surpris’d upon the road,  
Is crush’d athwart her body by the load  
Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound  
Her belly bruis’d, and trodden to the ground:  
In vain, with loosen’d curls, she crawls along;  
Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;  
Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;  
But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:  
So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,  
But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.  
Yet, for his galley sav’d, the grateful prince  
Is pleas’d th’ unhappy chief to recompense.  
Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,  
Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.  

From thence his way the Trojan hero bent </pre></div> </div>
