And on the shaded ocean rush’d the night;  
Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,  
But easy sleep their weary limbs compell’d.  
The Grecians had embark’d their naval pow’rs  
From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,  
Safe under covert of the silent night,  
And guided by th’ imperial galley’s light;  
When Sinon, favour’d by the partial gods,  
Unlock’d the horse, and op’d his dark abodes;  
Restor’d to vital air our hidden foes,  
Who joyful from their long confinement rose.  
Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,  
And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:  
Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;  
Nor was the Podalirian hero last,  
Nor injur’d Menelaus, nor the fam’d  
Epeus, who the fatal engine fram’d. </pre></div> </div>
