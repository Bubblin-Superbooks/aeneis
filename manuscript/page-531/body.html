Then when I made the foremost foes retire,  
And set whole heaps of conquer’d shields on fire;  
When Herilus in single fight I slew,  
Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;  
And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,  
Till the last ebbing soul return’d no more—  
Such if I stood renew’d, not these alarms,  
Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas’ arms;  
Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish’d, boast  
His rapes and murders on the Tuscan coast.  
Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring  
Relief, and hear a father and a king!  
If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see  
My son return with peace and victory;  
If the lov’d boy shall bless his father’s sight;  
If we shall meet again with more delight;  
Then draw my life in length; let me sustain, </pre></div> </div>
