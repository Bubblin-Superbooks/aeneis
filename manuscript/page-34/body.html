To cherish and advance the Trojan line.  
The subject world shall Rome’s dominion own,  
And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.  
An age is ripening in revolving fate  
When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,  
And sweet revenge her conqu’ring sons shall call,  
To crush the people that conspir’d her fall.  
Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,  
Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies  
Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,  
Our heav’n, the just reward of human toils,  
Securely shall repay with rites divine;  
And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.  
Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,  
And the stern age be soften’d into peace:  
Then banish’d Faith shall once again return,  
And Vestal fires in hallow’d temples burn; </pre></div> </div>
