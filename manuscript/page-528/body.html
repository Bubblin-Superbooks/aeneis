And, in a heav’n serene, refulgent arms appear:  
Redd’ning the skies, and glitt’ring all around,  
The temper’d metals clash, and yield a silver sound.  
The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine;  
Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,  
Presag’d th’ event, and joyful view’d, above,  
Th’ accomplish’d promise of the Queen of Love.  
Then, to th’ Arcadian king: “This prodigy  
(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me.  
Heav’n calls me to the war: th’ expected sign  
Is giv’n of promis’d aid, and arms divine.  
My goddess mother, whose indulgent care  
Foresaw the dangers of the growing war,  
This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms,  
Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,  
Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow’d  
Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood. </pre></div> </div>
