These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;  
Consum’d on mortals with prodigious waste.  
Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,  
Of winged southern winds and cloudy store  
As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;  
And fears are added, and avenging flame.  
Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair  
His broken axletrees and blunted war,  
And send him forth again with furbish’d arms,  
To wake the lazy war with trumpets’ loud alarms.  
The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold  
The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.  
Full on the crest the Gorgon’s head they place,  
With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face.  

“My sons,” said Vulcan, “set your tasks aside;  
Your strength and master-skill must now be tried. </pre></div> </div>
