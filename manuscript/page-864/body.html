And shiv’ring cold congeals his vital blood.  
The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short  
For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort.  
And as, when heavy sleep has clos’d the sight,  
The sickly fancy labours in the night;  
We seem to run; and, destitute of force,  
Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:  
In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;  
The nerves, unbrac’d, their usual strength deny;  
And on the tongue the falt’ring accents die:  
So Turnus far’d; whatever means he tried,  
All force of arms and points of art employ’d,  
The Fury flew athwart, and made th’ endeavor void.  

A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;  
He star’d about, nor aid nor issue found;  
His own men stop the pass, and his own walls</pre></div> </div>
