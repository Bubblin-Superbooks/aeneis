South, East, and West with mix’d confusion roar,  
And roll the foaming billows to the shore.  
The cables crack; the sailors’ fearful cries  
Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;  
And heav’n itself is ravish’d from their eyes.  
Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;  
Then flashing fires the transient light renew;  
The face of things a frightful image bears,  
And present death in various forms appears.  
Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,  
With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;  
And, “Thrice and four times happy those,” he cried,  
“That under Ilian walls before their parents died!  
Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!  
Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,  
And lie by noble Hector on the plain,  
Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields </pre></div> </div>
