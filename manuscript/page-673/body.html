Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.  
Of air condens’d a spectre soon she made;  
And, what Aeneas was, such seem’d the shade.  
Adorn’d with Dardan arms, the phantom bore  
His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;  
This hand appear’d a shining sword to wield,  
And that sustain’d an imitated shield.  
With manly mien he stalk’d along the ground,  
Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.  
(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,  
Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)  
The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare,  
And flourishes his empty sword in air.  
At this, advancing, Turnus hurl’d his spear:  
The phantom wheel’d, and seem’d to fly for fear.  
Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,  
And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. </pre></div> </div>
