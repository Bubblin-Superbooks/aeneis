Desist, my much-lov’d lord, t’ indulge your pain;  
You bear no more than what the gods ordain.  
My fates permit me not from hence to fly;  
Nor he, the great controller of the sky.  
Long wand’ring ways for you the pow’rs decree;  
On land hard labours, and a length of sea.  
Then, after many painful years are past,  
On Latium’s happy shore you shall be cast,  
Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds  
The flow’ry meadows, and the feeding folds.  
There end your toils; and there your fates provide  
A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:  
There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,  
And you for lost Creusa weep no more.  
Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,  
Th’ imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;  
Or, stooping to the victor’s lust, disgrace </pre></div> </div>
