Enlighten’d thus, my just commands fulfil,  
Nor fear obedience to your mother’s will.  
Where yon disorder’d heap of ruin lies,  
Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise,  
Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,  
Below the wall’s foundation drives his mace,  
And heaves the building from the solid base.  
Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands  
Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,  
Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.  
See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,  
Bestrides the tow’r, refulgent thro’ the cloud:  
See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,  
And arms against the town the partial deities.  
Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labour end:  
Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:  
Haste; and a mother’s care your passage shall befriend.’ </pre></div> </div>
