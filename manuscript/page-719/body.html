Trojans and Latians vie with like desires  
To make the field of battle shine with fires,  
And the promiscuous blaze to heav’n aspires.  

Now had the morning thrice renew’d the light,  
And thrice dispell’d the shadows of the night,  
When those who round the wasted fires remain,  
Perform the last sad office to the slain.  
They rake the yet warm ashes from below;  
These, and the bones unburn’d, in earth bestow;  
These relics with their country rites they grace,  
And raise a mount of turf to mark the place.  

But, in the palace of the king, appears  
A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.  
Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;  
Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons. </pre></div> </div>
