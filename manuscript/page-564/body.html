O let not me the widow’s tears renew!  
Nor let a mother’s curse my name pursue:  
Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,  
Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,  
Her age committing to the seas and wind,  
When ev’ry weary matron stay’d behind.”  
To this, Euryalus: “You plead in vain,  
And but protract the cause you cannot gain.  
No more delays, but haste!” With that, he wakes  
The nodding watch; each to his office takes.  
The guard reliev’d, the gen’rous couple went  
To find the council at the royal tent.  

All creatures else forgot their daily care,  
And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;  
Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate  
In nightly council for th’ indanger’d state. </pre></div> </div>
