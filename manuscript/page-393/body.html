Free from their harness, graze the flow’ry ground.  
The love of horses which they had, alive,  
And care of chariots, after death survive.  
Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;  
Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,  
Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po  
Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.  
Here patriots live, who, for their country’s good,  
In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:  
Priests of unblemish’d lives here make abode,  
And poets worthy their inspiring god;  
And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,  
Who grac’d their age with new-invented arts:  
Those who to worth their bounty did extend,  
And those who knew that bounty to commend.  
The heads of these with holy fillets bound,  
And all their temples were with garlands crown’d. </pre></div> </div>
