A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,  
And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.  
Ere this, a flying rumour had been spread  
That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,  
Expell’d and exil’d; that the coast was free  
From foreign or domestic enemy.  

“We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea.  
By Naxos, fam’d for vintage, make our way;  
Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight  
Of Paros’ isle, with marble quarries white.  
We pass the scatter’d isles of Cyclades,  
That, scarce distinguish’d, seem to stud the seas.  
The shouts of sailors double near the shores;  
They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars.  
‘All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!’ they cry,  
And swiftly thro’ the foamy billows fly. </pre></div> </div>
