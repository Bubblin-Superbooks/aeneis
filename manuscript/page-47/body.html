Lay deep foundations for a theatre;  
From marble quarries mighty columns hew,  
For ornaments of scenes, and future view.  
Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,  
As exercise the bees in flow’ry plains,  
When winter past, and summer scarce begun,  
Invites them forth to labour in the sun;  
Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense  
Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;  
Some at the gate stand ready to receive  
The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;  
All with united force, combine to drive  
The lazy drones from the laborious hive:  
With envy stung, they view each other’s deeds;  
The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.  
“Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!”  
Aeneas said, and view’d, with lifted eyes, </pre></div> </div>
