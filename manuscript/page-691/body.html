And wash’d his wounds by Tiber’s yellow flood:  
Oppress’d with anguish, panting, and o’erspent,  
His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.  
A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;  
His heavier arms lay scatter’d on the plain:  
A chosen train of youth around him stand;  
His drooping head was rested on his hand:  
His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;  
And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.  
Careful, concern’d his danger to prevent,  
He much enquir’d, and many a message sent  
To warn him from the field—alas! in vain!  
Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!  
O’er his broad shield still gush’d the yawning wound,  
And drew a bloody trail along the ground.  
Far off he heard their cries, far off divin’d  
The dire event, with a foreboding mind. </pre></div> </div>
