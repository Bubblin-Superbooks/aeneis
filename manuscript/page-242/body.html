Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,  
Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,  
Nor mov’d with hands profane his father’s dust:  
Why should he then reject a suit so just!  
Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!  
Can he this last, this only pray’r deny!  
Let him at least his dang’rous flight delay,  
Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.  
The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:  
Let him pursue the promis’d Latian shore.  
A short delay is all I ask him now;  
A pause of grief, an interval from woe,  
Till my soft soul be temper’d to sustain  
Accustom’d sorrows, and inur’d to pain.  
If you in pity grant this one request,  
My death shall glut the hatred of his breast.”  
This mournful message pious Anna bears, </pre></div> </div>
