If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,  
The great Messapus yet remains our friend:  
Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;  
Th’ Italian chiefs and princes join their pow’rs:  
Nor least in number, nor in name the last,  
Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac’d  
Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon  
Contains an army in herself alone,  
And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,  
With glitt’ring shields, in brazen armour bright.  
Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,  
And I alone the public peace withstand;  
If you consent, he shall not be refus’d,  
Nor find a hand to victory unus’d.  
This new Achilles, let him take the field,  
With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield!  
For you, my royal father, and my fame, </pre></div> </div>
