I bent my knees against the ground; once more  
The violated myrtle ran with gore.  
Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb  
Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,  
A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew’d  
My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:  
‘Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?  
O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!  
Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:  
The tears distil not from the wounded wood;  
But ev’ry drop this living tree contains  
Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.  
O fly from this unhospitable shore,  
Warn’d by my fate; for I am Polydore!  
Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,  
Again shoot upward, by my blood renew’d.’ </pre></div> </div>
