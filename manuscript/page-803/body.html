“For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight  
Of one expos’d for all, in single fight?

And Tuscan army; count ’em as they stand:  
Undaunted to the battle if we go,  
Scarce ev’ry second man will share a foe.  
Turnus, ’tis true, in this unequal strife,  
Shall lose, with honour, his devoted life,  
Or change it rather for immortal fame,  
Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:  
But you, a servile and inglorious band,  
For foreign lords shall sow your native land, </pre></div> </div>
