The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;  
Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:  
The Trojan sinks, and Neptune’s son prevails.  
Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,  
To single fight the boldest foe defied;  
Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o’ercame,  
And not belied his mighty father’s fame.  
Salius to death the great Antronius sent:  
But the same fate the victor underwent,  
Slain by Nealces’ hand, well-skill’d to throw  
The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.  

Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;  
By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:  
Victors and vanquish’d, in the various field,  
Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.  
The gods from heav’n survey the fatal strife, </pre></div> </div>
