Then Nisus thus: “Alas! thy tender years  
Would minister new matter to my fears.  
So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,  
Restore me to thy lov’d embrace with life,  
Condemn’d to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)  
This thy request is cruel and unjust.  
But if some chance—as many chances are,  
And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war—  
If one should reach my head, there let it fall,  
And spare thy life; I would not perish all.  
Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:  
Live thou to mourn thy love’s unhappy fate;  
To bear my mangled body from the foe,  
Or buy it back, and fun’ral rites bestow.  
Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,  
Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. </pre></div> </div>
