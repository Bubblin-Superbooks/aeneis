“Descending thence, I scape thro’ foes and fire:  
Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.  
Arriv’d at home, he, for whose only sake,  
Or most for his, such toils I undertake,  
The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,  
I purpos’d to secure on Ida’s height,  
Refus’d the journey, resolute to die  
And add his fun’rals to the fate of Troy,  
Rather than exile and old age sustain.  
‘Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev’ry vein.  
Had Heav’n decreed that I should life enjoy,  
Heav’n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.  
’Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,  
Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.  
Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,  
And give this useless corpse a long adieu. </pre></div> </div>
