Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,  
Without a prize to gratify his pains.  
Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show  
An archer’s art, and boast his twanging bow.  
The feather’d arrow gave a dire portent,  
And latter augurs judge from this event.  
Chaf’d by the speed, it fir’d; and, as it flew,  
A trail of following flames ascending drew:  
Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;  
Across the skies as falling meteors play,  
And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.  
The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,  
And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray’r.  
The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,  
And strain’d Acestes with a close embrace;  
Then, hon’ring him with gifts above the rest,  
Turn’d the bad omen, nor his fears confess’d. </pre></div> </div>
