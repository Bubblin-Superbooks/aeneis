So shines a cloud, when edg’d with adverse light.  
He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try  
The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;  
But most admires the shield’s mysterious mould,  
And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:  
For these, emboss’d, the heav’nly smith had wrought  
(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)  
The wars in order, and the race divine  
Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.  
The cave of Mars was dress’d with mossy greens:  
There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.  
Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;  
The foster dam loll’d out her fawning tongue:  
They suck’d secure, while, bending back her head,  
She lick’d their tender limbs, and form’d them as they fed.  
Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games </pre></div> </div>
