Shall such affronts as these alone inflame  
The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?  
My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,  
And final ruin, for a ravish’d wife.  
Was ’t not enough, that, punish’d for the crime,  
They fell; but will they fall a second time?  
One would have thought they paid enough before,  
To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.  
Can they securely trust their feeble wall,  
A slight partition, a thin interval,  
Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho’ built  
By hands divine, yet perish’d by their guilt?  
Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,  
To force from out their lines these dastard bands.  
Less than a thousand ships will end this war,  
Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.  
Let all the Tuscans, all th’ Arcadians, join! </pre></div> </div>
