No female arts or aids she left untried,  
Nor counsels unexplor’d, before she died.  
“Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;  
They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh.  
The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,  
Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind.  
Could I have thought this threat’ning blow so near,  
My tender soul had been forewarn’d to bear.  
But do not you my last request deny;  
With yon perfidious man your int’rest try,  
And bring me news, if I must live or die.  
You are his fav’rite; you alone can find  
The dark recesses of his inmost mind:  
In all his trusted secrets you have part,  
And know the soft approaches to his heart.  
Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;  
Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go, </pre></div> </div>
