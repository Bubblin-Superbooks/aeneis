The name and fortune of your native place,  
The fame and valour of the Phrygian race?  
We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,  
Nor so remote from Phoebus’ influence.  
Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,  
Or, driv’n by tempests from your first intent,  
You seek the good Acestes’ government,  
Your men shall be receiv’d, your fleet repair’d,  
And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:  
Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow’rs  
To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow’rs,  
My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.  
And would to Heav’n, the Storm, you felt, would bring  
On Carthaginian coasts your wand’ring king.  
My people shall, by my command, explore  
The ports and creeks of ev’ry winding shore, </pre></div> </div>
