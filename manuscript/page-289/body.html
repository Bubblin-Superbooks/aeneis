This was ordain’d for Mnestheus to possess;  
In war for his defence, for ornament in peace.  
Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,  
But yet so pond’rous with its plates of gold,  
That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;  
Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o’er the plain  
Pursued and lightly seiz’d the Trojan train.  
The third, succeeding to the last reward,  
Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar’d,  
With figures prominent, and richly wrought,  
And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.  

Thus all, rewarded by the hero’s hands,  
Their conqu’ring temples bound with purple bands;  
And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,  
Brought back his galley shatter’d with the shock.  
Forlorn she look’d, without an aiding oar, </pre></div> </div>
