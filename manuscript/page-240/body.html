Fearful of winter, and of future wants,  
T’ invade the corn, and to their cells convey  
The plunder’d forage of their yellow prey.  
The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,  
Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:  
Some set their shoulders to the pond’rous grain;  
Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;  
All ply their sev’ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.  

What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,  
When, from the tow’r, she saw the cover’d shore,  
And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,  
Mix’d with the murmurs of the wat’ry war!  
All-pow’rful Love! what changes canst thou cause  
In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!  
Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:  
To pray’rs and mean submissions she descends. </pre></div> </div>
