Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?  

The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore  
To fam’d Anchises on th’ Idaean shore?  
It calls into my mind, tho’ then a child,  
When Teucer came, from Salamis exil’d,  
And sought my father’s aid, to be restor’d:  
My father Belus then with fire and sword  
Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,  
And, conqu’ring, finish’d the successful war.  
From him the Trojan siege I understood,  
The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.  
Your foe himself the Dardan valour prais’d,  
And his own ancestry from Trojans rais’d.  
Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,  
If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:  
For I myself, like you, have been distress’d, </pre></div> </div>
