Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate,  
And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.’  

“This when the priest with friendly voice declar’d,  
He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar’d:  
Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want  
With heavy gold, and polish’d elephant;  
Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board,  
And ev’ry ship with sums of silver stor’d.  
A trusty coat of mail to me he sent,  
Thrice chain’d with gold, for use and ornament;  
The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest,  
That flourish’d with a plume and waving crest.  
Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends;  
And large recruits he to my navy sends:  
Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores;  
Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars. </pre></div> </div>
