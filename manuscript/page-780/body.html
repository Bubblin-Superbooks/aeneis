Thro’ the black forest and the ferny brake,  
Unknowingly secure, their way they take;  
From the rough mountains to the plain descend,  
And there, in order drawn, their line extend.  
Both armies now in open fields are seen;  
Nor far the distance of the space between.  
Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees,  
Thro’ smoking fields, his hast’ning enemies;  
And Turnus views the Trojans in array,  
And hears th’ approaching horses proudly neigh.  
Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join’d;  
But westward to the sea the sun declin’d.  
Intrench’d before the town both armies lie,  
While night with sable wings involves the sky.  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
