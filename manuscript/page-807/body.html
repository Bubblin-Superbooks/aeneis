Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,  
Born of Arcadian mix’d with Tuscan blood,  
Gylippus’ sons: the fatal jav’lin flew,  
Aim’d at the midmost of the friendly crew.  
A passage thro’ the jointed arms it found,  
Just where the belt was to the body bound,  
And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.  
Then, fir’d with pious rage, the gen’rous train  
Run madly forward to revenge the slain.  
And some with eager haste their jav’lins throw;  
And some with sword in hand assault the foe.  

The wish’d insult the Latine troops embrace,  
And meet their ardour in the middle space.  
The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,  
With equal courage obviate their design.  
Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate </pre></div> </div>
