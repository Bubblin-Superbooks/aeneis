With turrets crown’d! (on Ida’s holy hill  
Fierce tigers, rein’d and curb’d, obey thy will.)  
Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;  
And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.”  

He said no more. And now renewing day  
Had chas’d the shadows of the night away.  
He charg’d the soldiers, with preventing care,  
Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;  
Warn’d of th’ ensuing fight, and bade ’em hope the war.  
Now, his lofty poop, he view’d below  
His camp incompass’d, and th’ inclosing foe.  
His blazing shield, imbrac’d, he held on high;  
The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.  
Hope arms their courage: from their tow’rs they throw  
Their darts with double force, and drive the foe. </pre></div> </div>
