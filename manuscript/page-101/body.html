With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,  
The wreaths and relics of th’ immortal fire.  

“Now peals of shouts come thund’ring from afar,  
Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:  
The noise approaches, tho’ our palace stood  
Aloof from streets, encompass’d with a wood.  
Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th’ alarms  
Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.  
Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,  
But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,  
And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.  
Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,  
Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;  
Or deluges, descending on the plains,  
Sweep o’er the yellow year, destroy the pains  
Of lab’ring oxen and the peasant’s gains; </pre></div> </div>
