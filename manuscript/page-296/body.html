But fortune’s errors give me leave to mend,  
At least to pity my deserving friend.”  
He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws  
(Pond’rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)  
A lion’s hide: to Salius this he gives.  
Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.  
“If such rewards to vanquish’d men are due.”  
He said, “and falling is to rise by you,  
What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,  
Who merited the first rewards and fame?  
In falling, both an equal fortune tried;  
Would fortune for my fall so well provide!”  
With this he pointed to his face, and show’d  
His hand and all his habit smear’d with blood.  
Th’ indulgent father of the people smil’d,  
And caus’d to be produc’d an ample shield,  
Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, </pre></div> </div>
