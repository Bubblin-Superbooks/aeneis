The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,  
And, rushing forward, form a moving shed.  
These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:  
Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.  
But, where void spaces on the walls appear,  
Or thin defence, they pour their forces there.  
With poles and missive weapons, from afar,  
The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.  
Taught, by their ten years’ siege, defensive fight,  
They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,  
To break the penthouse with the pond’rous blow,  
Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:  
But could not bear th’ unequal combat long;  
For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,  
The ruin falls: their shatter’d shields give way,  
And their crush’d heads become an easy prey.  
They shrink for fear, abated of their rage, </pre></div> </div>
