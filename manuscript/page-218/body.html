Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,  
And rather would the tusky boar attend,  
Or see the tawny lion downward bend.  

Meantime, the gath’ring clouds obscure the skies:  
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;  
The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours  
A wintry deluge down, and sounding show’rs.  
The company, dispers’d, to converts ride,  
And seek the homely cots, or mountain’s hollow side.  
The rapid rains, descending from the hills,  
To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.  
The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,  
One common cavern in her bosom hides.  
Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,  
And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;  
Hell from below, and Juno from above, </pre></div> </div>
