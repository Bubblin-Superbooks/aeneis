From Agamemnon born—to Turnus’ aid  
A thousand men the youthful hero led,  
Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown’d,  
And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,  
And those who live by Sidicinian shores,  
And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,  
Cales’ and Osca’s old inhabitants,  
And rough Saticulans, inur’d to wants:  
Light demi-lances from afar they throw,  
Fasten’d with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.  
Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;  
And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.  

Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung,  
From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung,  
Who then in Teleboan Capri reign’d;  
But that short isle th’ ambitious youth disdain’d, </pre></div> </div>
