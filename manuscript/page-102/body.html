Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away  
Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish’d prey:  
The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far  
The wasteful ravage of the wat’ry war.  
Then Hector’s faith was manifestly clear’d,  
And Grecian frauds in open light appear’d.  
The palace of Deiphobus ascends  
In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.  
Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright  
With splendour not their own, and shine with Trojan light.  
New clamours and new clangours now arise,  
The sound of trumpets mix’d with fighting cries.  
With frenzy seiz’d, I run to meet th’ alarms,  
Resolv’d on death, resolv’d to die in arms,  
But first to gather friends, with them t’ oppose  
If fortune favour’d, and repel the foes; </pre></div> </div>
