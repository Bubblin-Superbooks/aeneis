War shall the country waste, and change the state.”  

Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,  
For counsel to his father Faunus went,  
And sought the shades renown’d for prophecy  
Which near Albunea’s sulph’rous fountain lie.  
To these the Latian and the Sabine land  
Fly, when distress’d, and thence relief demand.  
The priest on skins of off’rings takes his ease,  
And nightly visions in his slumber sees;  
A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,  
And, flutt’ring round his temples, deafs his ears:  
These he consults, the future fates to know,  
From pow’rs above, and from the fiends below.  
Here, for the gods’ advice, Latinus flies,  
Off’ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:  
Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir’d, </pre></div> </div>
