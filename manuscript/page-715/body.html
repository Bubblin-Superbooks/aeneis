Nor grudge th’ alliance I so gladly made.  
’Twas not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,  
But my own crime, for having liv’d too long.  
Yet, since the gods had destin’d him to die,  
At least he led the way to victory:  
First for his friends he won the fatal shore,  
And sent whole herds of slaughter’d foes before;  
A death too great, too glorious to deplore.  
Nor will I add new honours to thy grave,  
Content with those the Trojan hero gave:  
That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design’d,  
In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join’d.  
Great spoils and trophies, gain’d by thee, they bear:  
Then let thy own achievements be thy share.  
Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,  
Whose mighty trunk had better grac’d the wood,  
If Pallas had arriv’d, with equal length </pre></div> </div>
