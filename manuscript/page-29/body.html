Whether to deem ’em dead, or in distress.  
Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate  
Of brave Orontes, and th’ uncertain state  
Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.  
The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.  

When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys  
Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,  
At length on Libyan realms he fix’d his eyes:  
Whom, pond’ring thus on human miseries,  
When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,  
Not free from tears, her heav’nly sire bespoke:  

“O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand  
Disperses thunder on the seas and land,  
Disposing all with absolute command;  
How could my pious son thy pow’r incense? </pre></div> </div>
