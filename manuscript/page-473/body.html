And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore.  
Like Hercules himself his son appears,  
In salvage pomp; a lion’s hide he wears;  
About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;  
The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.  
Thus, like the god his father, homely dress’d,  
He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.  

Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came,  
(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)  
Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:  
Arm’d Argive horse they led, and in the front appear.  
Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain’s height  
With rapid course descending to the fight;  
They rush along; the rattling woods give way;  
The branches bend before their sweepy sway. </pre></div> </div>
