’Twas dead of night; when to his slumb’ring eyes  
His father’s shade descended from the skies,  
And thus he spoke: “O more than vital breath,  
Lov’d while I liv’d, and dear ev’n after death;  
O son, in various toils and troubles toss’d,  
The King of Heav’n employs my careful ghost  
On his commands: the god, who sav’d from fire  
Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.  
The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,  
And here the coward train and woman leave:  
The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,  
Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.  
The stern Italians will their courage try;  
Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.  
But first to Pluto’s palace you shall go,  
And seek my shade among the blest below: </pre></div> </div>
