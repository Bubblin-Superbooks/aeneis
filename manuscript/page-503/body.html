And toss’d about his head his knotted oak.  
Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows’ flight,  
He clomb, with eager haste, th’ aerial height.  
Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;  
Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face,  
Confess’d the god’s approach. Trembling he springs,  
As terror had increas’d his feet with wings;  
Nor stay’d for stairs; but down the depth he threw  
His body, on his back the door he drew  
(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains  
His father hew’d it out, and bound with iron chains):  
He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos’d,  
And bars and levers to his foe oppos’d.  
The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;  
The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;  
Survey’d the mouth of the forbidden hold,  
And here and there his raging eyes he roll’d. </pre></div> </div>
