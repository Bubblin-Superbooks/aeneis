Hate to Mezentius arm’d five hundred more,  
Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore:  
Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover’d o’er.  
These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep  
With stretching oars at once the glassy deep.  
Him and his martial train the Triton bears;  
High on his poop the sea-green god appears:  
Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,  
And at the blast the billows dance around.  
A hairy man above the waist he shows;  
A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows;  
And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides,  
And froth and foam augment the murm’ring tides.  

Full thirty ships transport the chosen train </pre></div> </div>
