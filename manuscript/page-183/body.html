“Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor’d,  
Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord.  
A noble present to my son she brought,  
A robe with flow’rs on golden tissue wrought,  
A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside  
Of precious texture, and of Asian pride.  
‘Accept,’ she said, ‘these monuments of love,  
Which in my youth with happier hands I wove:  
Regard these trifles for the giver’s sake;  
’Tis the last present Hector’s wife can make.  
Thou call’st my lost Astyanax to mind;  
In thee his features and his form I find:  
His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame;  
Such were his motions; such was all his frame;  
And ah! had Heav’n so pleas’d, his years had been the same.’ </pre></div> </div>
