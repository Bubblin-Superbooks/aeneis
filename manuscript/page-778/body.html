All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,  
Are crush’d in crowds, a mingled multitude.  
Some happy few escape: the throng too late  
Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.  
Ev’n in the sight of home, the wretched sire  
Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.  
Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,  
But leave their friends excluded with their foes.  
The vanquish’d cry; the victors loudly shout;  
’Tis terror all within, and slaughter all without.  
Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,  
Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.  

The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,  
Arm’d on the tow’rs, the common danger share:  
So much of zeal their country’s cause inspir’d;  
So much Camilla’s great example fir’d. </pre></div> </div>
