Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,  
And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray’r;  
And Palinurus’ name the place shall bear.”  
This calm’d his cares; sooth’d with his future fame,  
And pleas’d to hear his propagated name.

Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;  
Observ’d their passage thro’ the shady wood,  
And mark’d their near approaches to the flood.  
Then thus he call’d aloud, inflam’d with wrath:  
“Mortal, whate’er, who this forbidden path  
In arms presum’st to tread, I charge thee, stand,  
And tell thy name, and bus’ness in the land.  
Know this, the realm of night; the Stygian shore:  
My boat conveys no living bodies o’er;  
Nor was I pleas’d great Theseus once to bear, </pre></div> </div>
