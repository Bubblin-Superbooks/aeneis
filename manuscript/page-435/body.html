The god began our line, who rules above;  
And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:  
And hither are we come, by his command,  
To crave admission in your happy land.  
How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour’d,  
Our plains, our temples, and our town devour’d;  
What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms  
Shook Asia’s crown with European arms;  
Ev’n such have heard, if any such there be,  
Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;  
And such as, born beneath the burning sky  
And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.  
From that dire deluge, thro’ the wat’ry waste,  
Such length of years, such various perils past,  
At last escap’d, to Latium we repair,  
To beg what you without your want may spare:  
The common water, and the common air; </pre></div> </div>
