Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.  
Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.  
And seeks his life, regardless of her own.  

This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:  
Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,  
And threw, but first to Heav’n address’d his vows:  
“O patron of Socrates’ high abodes,  
Phoebus, the ruling pow’r among the gods,  
Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine  
Are fell’d for thee, and to thy glory shine;  
By thee protected with our naked soles,  
Thro’ flames unsing’d we march, and tread the kindled coals  
Give me, propitious pow’r, to wash away  
The stains of this dishonourable day:  
Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim, </pre></div> </div>
