The prince pursued the parting deity  
With words like these: “Ah! whither do you fly?  
Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son  
In borrow’d shapes, and his embrace to shun;  
Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;  
And still to speak in accents not your own.”  
Against the goddess these complaints he made,  
But took the path, and her commands obey’d.  
They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds  
With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,  
That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,  
Or force to tell the causes of their way.  
This part perform’d, the goddess flies sublime  
To visit Paphos and her native clime;  
Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,  
With vows are offer’d, and with solemn pray’r:  
A hundred altars in her temple smoke; </pre></div> </div>
