If you so hard a toil will undertake,  
As twice to pass th’ innavigable lake;  
Receive my counsel. In the neighb’ring grove  
There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove  
Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night  
Conceal the happy plant from human sight.  
One bough it bears; but wondrous to behold!  
The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:  
This from the vulgar branches must be torn,  
And to fair Proserpine the present borne,  
Ere leave be giv’n to tempt the nether skies.  
The first thus rent a second will arise,  
And the same metal the same room supplies.  
Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see  
The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:  
Then rend it off, as holy rites command;  
The willing metal will obey thy hand, </pre></div> </div>
