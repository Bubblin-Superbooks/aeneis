And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass’d,  
And Alban plains, from Alba’s name so call’d,  
Where King Latinus then his oxen stall’d;  
Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,  
And miss’d his friend, and cast his eyes around:  
“Ah wretch!” he cried, “where have I left behind  
Th’ unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?  
Or what way take?” Again he ventures back,  
And treads the mazes of his former track.  
He winds the wood, and, list’ning, hears the noise  
Of tramping coursers, and the riders’ voice.  
The sound approach’d; and suddenly he view’d  
The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,  
Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain  
The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.  
What should he next attempt? what arms employ,  
What fruitless force, to free the captive boy? </pre></div> </div>
