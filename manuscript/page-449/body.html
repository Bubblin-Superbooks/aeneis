The wooden engine flies and whirls about,  
Admir’d, with clamours, of the beardless rout;  
They lash aloud; each other they provoke,  
And lend their little souls at ev’ry stroke:  
Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows  
Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.  
Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,  
And adds new ills to those contriv’d before:  
She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng  
Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,  
Wand’ring thro’ woods and wilds, and devious ways,  
And with these arts the Trojan match delays.  
She feign’d the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,  
And to the buxom god the virgin vow’d.  
“Evoe! O Bacchus!” thus began the song;  
And “Evoe!” answer’d all the female throng.  
“O virgin! worthy thee alone!” she cried; </pre></div> </div>
