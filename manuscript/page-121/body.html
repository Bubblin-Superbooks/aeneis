Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,  
The fear of death gave place to nature’s law;  
And, shaking more with anger than with age,  
‘The gods,’ said he, ‘requite thy brutal rage!  
As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,  
If there be gods in heav’n, and gods be just:  
Who tak’st in wrongs an insolent delight;  
With a son’s death t’ infect a father’s sight.  
Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire  
To call thee his; not he, thy vaunted sire,  
Thus us’d my wretched age: the gods he fear’d,  
The laws of nature and of nations heard.  
He cheer’d my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,  
The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;  
Pitied the woes a parent underwent,  
And sent me back in safety from his tent.’ </pre></div> </div>
