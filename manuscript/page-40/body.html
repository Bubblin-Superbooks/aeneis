Before the sacred altar made him bleed,  
And long from her conceal’d the cruel deed.  
Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin’d,  
To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.  
At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears  
Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares,  
And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.  
The cruel altars and his fate he tells,  
And the dire secret of his house reveals,  
Then warns the widow, with her household gods,  
To seek a refuge in remote abodes.  
Last, to support her in so long a way,  
He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.  
Admonish’d thus, and seiz’d with mortal fright,  
The queen provides companions of her flight:  
They meet, and all combine to leave the state,  
Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate. </pre></div> </div>
