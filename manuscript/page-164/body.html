And in the grass their glitt’ring weapons hide;  
Then, when along the crooked shore we hear  
Their clatt’ring wings, and saw the foes appear,  
Misenus sounds a charge: we take th’ alarm,  
And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.  
In this new kind of combat all employ  
Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy.  
In vain, the fated skin is proof to wounds;  
And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.  
At length rebuff’d, they leave their mangled prey,  
And their stretch’d pinions to the skies display.  
Yet one remain’d, the messenger of Fate:  
High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,  
And thus her dismal errand did relate:  
‘What! not contented with our oxen slain,  
Dare you with Heav’n an impious war maintain,  
And drive the Harpies from their native reign? </pre></div> </div>
