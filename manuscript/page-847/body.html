Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,  
And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.  
Courage conspires with chance, and both engage  
With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.  
As when two bulls for their fair female fight  
In Sila’s shades, or on Taburnus’ height;  
With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;  
Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,  
And wait th’ event; which victor they shall bear,  
And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:  
With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,  
And push for push, and wound for wound return;  
Their dewlaps gor’d, their sides are lav’d in blood;  
Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro’ the wood:  
Such was the combat in the listed ground;  
So clash their swords, and so their shields resound. </pre></div> </div>
