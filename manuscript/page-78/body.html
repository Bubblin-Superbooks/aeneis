“By destiny compell’d, and in despair,  
The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,  
And by Minerva’s aid a fabric rear’d,  
Which like a steed of monstrous height appear’d:  
The sides were plank’d with pine; they feign’d it made  
For their return, and this the vow they paid.  
Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side  
Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:  
With inward arms the dire machine they load,  
And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.  
In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle  
(While Fortune did on Priam’s empire smile)  
Renown’d for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,  
Where ships expos’d to wind and weather lay.  
There was their fleet conceal’d. We thought, for Greece  
Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release. </pre></div> </div>
