Their pity to themselves renews their cries.  
“Alas!” said one, “what oceans yet remain  
For us to sail! what labours to sustain!”  
All take the word, and, with a gen’ral groan,  
Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own.  

The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,  
And in a woman’s form her heav’nly limbs restrains.  
In face and shape old Beroe she became,  
Doryclus’ wife, a venerable dame,  
Once blest with riches, and a mother’s name.  
Thus chang’d, amidst the crying crowd she ran,  
Mix’d with the matrons, and these words began:  
“O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow’r,  
Nor flames, destroy’d, in Troy’s unhappy hour!  
O wretched we, reserv’d by cruel fate,  
Beyond the ruins of the sinking state! </pre></div> </div>
