The clowns, return’d, from battle bear the slain,  
Implore the gods, and to their king complain.  
The corps of Almon and the rest are shown;  
Shrieks, clamours, murmurs, fill the frighted town.  
Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,  
And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;  
Proclaims his private injuries aloud,  
A solemn promise made, and disavow’d;  
A foreign son is sought, and a mix’d mungril brood.  
Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,  
In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,  
And lead his dances with dishevel’d hair,  
Increase the clamour, and the war demand,  
(Such was Amata’s int’rest in the land,)  
Against the public sanctions of the peace,  
Against all omens of their ill success.  
With fates averse, the rout in arms resort, </pre></div> </div>
