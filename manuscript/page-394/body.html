To these the Sibyl thus her speech address’d,  
And first to him surrounded by the rest  
Tow’ring his height, and ample was his breast;  
“Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,  
Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way  
To find the hero, for whose only sake  
We sought the dark abodes, and cross’d the bitter lake?”  
To this the sacred poet thus replied:  
“In no fix’d place the happy souls reside.  
In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,  
By crystal streams, that murmur thro’ the meads:  
But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;  
The path conducts you to your journey’s end.”  
This said, he led them up the mountain’s brow,  
And shews them all the shining fields below. </pre></div> </div>
