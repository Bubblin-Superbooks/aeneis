Poles, sharpen’d in the flames, from high they throw,  
With imitated darts, to gall the foe.  
Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath,  
And crowd each other to be first in death.  
Meantime to Turnus, ambush’d in the shade,  
With heavy tidings came th’ unhappy maid:  
“The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill’d;  
The foes, entirely masters of the field,  
Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:  
The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.”  

Inflam’d with rage, (for so the Furies fire  
The Daunian’s breast, and so the Fates require,)  
He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain  
Possess’d, and downward issues on the plain.  
Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed  
From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. </pre></div> </div>
