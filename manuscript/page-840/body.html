And see your brother bleeding on the plain?  
For to what pow’r can Turnus have recourse,  
Or how resist his fate’s prevailing force?  
These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:  
Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.  
I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,  
My name invoking to revenge his death.  
Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place,  
To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.  
On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;  
His vest and armour are the victor’s prize.  
Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,  
Which only wanted, to complete my shame?  
How will the Latins hoot their champion’s flight!  
How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!  
Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,  
(Since those above so small compassion show,) </pre></div> </div>
