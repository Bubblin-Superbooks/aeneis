Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.  
She saw the Trojan and his joyful train  
Descend upon the shore, desert the main,  
Design a town, and, with unhop’d success,  
Th’ embassadors return with promis’d peace.  
Then, pierc’d with pain, she shook her haughty head,  
Sigh’d from her inward soul, and thus she said:  
“O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!  
O fates of Troy, which Juno’s fates oppose!  
Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,  
But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?  
When execrable Troy in ashes lay,  
Thro’ fires and swords and seas they forc’d their way.  
Then vanquish’d Juno must in vain contend,  
Her rage disarm’d, her empire at an end.  
Breathless and tir’d, is all my fury spent?  
Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? </pre></div> </div>
