Hastes to the nether world his destin’d way.  
Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went  
From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;  
And here th’ access a gloomy grove defends,  
And there th’ unnavigable lake extends,  
O’er whose unhappy waters, void of light,  
No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;  
Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,  
And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.  
From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,  
And give the name Avernus to the lake.  
Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,  
For sacrifice the pious hero brought.  
The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;  
Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,  
Invoking Hecate hither to repair:  
A pow’rful name in hell and upper air. </pre></div> </div>
