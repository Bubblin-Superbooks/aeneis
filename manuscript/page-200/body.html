Forewarn’d by Helenus, we strive to shun  
Charybdis’ gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.  
An equal fate on either side appears:  
We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;  
For, from Pelorus’ point, the North arose,  
And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.  
His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way  
By Thapsus and Megara’s winding bay.  
This passage Achaemenides had shown,  
Tracing the course which he before had run.  

“Right o’er against Plemmyrium’s wat’ry strand,  
There lies an isle once call’d th’ Ortygian land.  
Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found  
From Greece a secret passage under ground,  
By love to beauteous Arethusa led;  
And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed. </pre></div> </div>
