Fierce Hyllus threaten’d high, and, face to face,  
Affronted Turnus in the middle space:  
The prince encounter’d him in full career,  
And at his temples aim’d the deadly spear;  
So fatally the flying weapon sped,  
That thro’ his brazen helm it pierc’d his head.  
Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus’ hand,  
In vain the strongest of th’ Arcadian band:  
Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford  
Availing aid against th’ Aenean sword,  
Which to his naked heart pursued the course;  
Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.  

Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow’rs,  
Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow’rs,  
Were doom’d to kill, while Heav’n prolong’d his date; </pre></div> </div>
