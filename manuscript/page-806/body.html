“At length ’tis granted, what I long desir’d!  
This, this is what my frequent vows requir’d.  
Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey.  
Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.  
These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,  
Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:  
But soon, like him, they shall be forc’d to sea  
By strength united, and forego the prey.  
Your timely succour to your country bring,  
Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king.”  

He said; and, pressing onward thro’ the crew,  
Pois’d in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.  
The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,  
Came driving on, nor miss’d the mark design’d.  
At once the cornel rattled in the skies;  
At once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise. </pre></div> </div>
