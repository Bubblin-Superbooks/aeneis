And seconds with her own her sister’s tears:  
But all her arts are still employ’d in vain;  
Again she comes, and is refus’d again.  
His harden’d heart nor pray’rs nor threat’nings move;  
Fate, and the god, had stopp’d his ears to love.  

As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,

This way and that the mountain oak they bend,  
His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;  
With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;  
The hollow valleys echo to the sound:  
Unmov’d, the royal plant their fury mocks,  
Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;  
Far as he shoots his tow’ring head on high,  
So deep in earth his fix’d foundations lie.  
No less a storm the Trojan hero bears; </pre></div> </div>
