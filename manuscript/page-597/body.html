“Twice-conquer’d cowards, now your shame is shown—  
Coop’d up a second time within your town!  
Who dare not issue forth in open field,  
But hold your walls before you for a shield.  
Thus treat you war? thus our alliance force?  
What gods, what madness, hither steer’d your course?  
You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,  
Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.  
Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,  
We bear our newborn infants to the flood;  
There bath’d amid the stream, our boys we hold,  
With winter harden’d, and inur’d to cold.  
They wake before the day to range the wood,  
Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer’d food.  
No sports, but what belong to war, they know: </pre></div> </div>
