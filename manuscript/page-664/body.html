The prince stood o’er the priest, and, at one blow,  
Sent him an off’ring to the shades below.  
His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,  
Design’d a trophy to the God of Wars.  

Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,  
And Umbro, born upon the mountains’ height.  
The champion cheers his troops t’ encounter those,  
And seeks revenge himself on other foes.  
At Anxur’s shield he drove; and, at the blow,  
Both shield and arm to ground together go.  
Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,  
And thought he wore impenetrable arms,  
So made by mutter’d spells; and, from the spheres,  
Had life secur’d, in vain, for length of years.  
Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod;  
A nymph his mother, his sire a god. </pre></div> </div>
