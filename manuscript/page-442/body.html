As if ’twere little from their town to chase,  
I thro’ the seas pursued their exil’d race;  
Ingag’d the heav’ns, oppos’d the stormy main;  
But billows roar’d, and tempests rag’d in vain.  
What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,  
When these they overpass, and those they shun?  
On Tiber’s shores they land, secure of fate,  
Triumphant o’er the storms and Juno’s hate.  
Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,  
And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia’s wrath,  
Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;  
What great offence had either people done?  
But I, the consort of the Thunderer,  
Have wag’d a long and unsuccessful war,  
With various arts and arms in vain have toil’d,  
And by a mortal man at length am foil’d.  
If native pow’r prevail not, shall I doubt </pre></div> </div>
