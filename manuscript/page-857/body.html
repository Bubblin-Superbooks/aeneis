Call them not Trojans: perish the renown  
And name of Troy, with that detested town.  
Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign  
And Rome’s immortal majesty remain.”  

Then thus the founder of mankind replies  
(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)  
“Can Saturn’s issue, and heav’n’s other heir,  
Such endless anger in her bosom bear?  
Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;  
But quench the choler you foment in vain.  
From ancient blood th’ Ausonian people sprung,  
Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.  
The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:  
I will, myself, their common rites provide;  
The natives shall command, the foreigners subside.  
All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; </pre></div> </div>
