Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,  
The god who taught your thund’ring arm the game?  
Where now your baffled honour? Where the spoil  
That fill’d your house, and fame that fill’d our isle?”  
Entellus, thus: “My soul is still the same,  
Unmov’d with fear, and mov’d with martial fame;  
But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,  
And scarce the shadow of a man remains.  
O could I turn to that fair prime again,  
That prime of which this boaster is so vain,  
The brave, who this decrepid age defies,  
Should feel my force, without the promis’d prize.”  

He said; and, rising at the word, he threw  
Two pond’rous gauntlets down in open view;  
Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,  
And sheathe his hands with in the listed field. </pre></div> </div>
