A lion’s hide, his body to defend;  
And good Alethes furnish’d him, beside,  
With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.

Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate  
With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears  
Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,  
And messages committed to their care,  
Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.  

The trenches first they pass’d; then took their way  
Where their proud foes in pitch’d pavilions lay;  
To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.  
They found the careless host dispers’d upon the plain,  
Who, gorg’d, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.  
Unharness’d chariots stand along the shore: </pre></div> </div>
