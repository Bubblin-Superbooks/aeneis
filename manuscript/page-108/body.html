But we, more num’rous, intercept his flight.  
As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,  
Has with unwary footing press’d a snake;  
He starts aside, astonish’d, when he spies  
His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;  
So from our arms surpris’d Androgeos flies.  
In vain; for him and his we compass’d round,  
Possess’d with fear, unknowing of the ground,  
And of their lives an easy conquest found.  
Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil’d.  
Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil’d,  
Swoln with success, and a daring mind,  
This new invention fatally design’d.  
‘My friends,’ said he, ‘since Fortune shows the way,  
’Tis fit we should th’ auspicious guide obey.  
For what has she these Grecian arms bestow’d,  
But their destruction, and the Trojans’ good? </pre></div> </div>
