Nor was Praeneste’s founder wanting there,  
Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:  
Found in the fire, and foster’d in the plains,  
A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,  
And leads to Turnus’ aid his country swains.  
His own Praeneste sends a chosen band,  
With those who plow Saturnia’s Gabine land;  
Besides the succour which cold Anien yields,  
The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,  
Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene—  
A num’rous rout, but all of naked men:  
Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,  
Nor drive the chariot thro’ the dusty field,  
But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,  
And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;  
The left foot naked, when they march to fight, </pre></div> </div>
