Th’ Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade.  
With that he roar’d aloud: the dreadful cry  
Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly  
Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.  
The neighb’ring Aetna trembling all around,  
The winding caverns echo to the sound.  
His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,  
And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.  
We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,  
And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten’d war:  
A dreadful council, with their heads on high;  
(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)  
Not yielding to the tow’ring tree of Jove,  
Or tallest cypress of Diana’s grove.  
New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail;  
We tug at ev’ry oar, and hoist up ev’ry sail,  
And take th’ advantage of the friendly gale. </pre></div> </div>
