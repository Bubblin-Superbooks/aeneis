Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart  
Pierc’d the proud Grecian’s only mortal part:  
Thus far, by fate’s decrees and thy commands,  
Thro’ ambient seas and thro’ devouring sands,  
Our exil’d crew has sought th’ Ausonian ground;  
And now, at length, the flying coast is found.  
Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,  
With fury has pursued her wand’ring race.  
Here cease, ye pow’rs, and let your vengeance end:  
Troy is no more, and can no more offend.  
And thou, O sacred maid, inspir’d to see  
Th’ event of things in dark futurity;  
Give me what Heav’n has promis’d to my fate,  
To conquer and command the Latian state;  
To fix my wand’ring gods, and find a place  
For the long exiles of the Trojan race.  
Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear </pre></div> </div>
