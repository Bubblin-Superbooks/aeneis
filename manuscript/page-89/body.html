“False tears true pity move; the king commands  
To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:  
Then adds these friendly words: ‘Dismiss thy fears;  
Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.  
But truly tell, was it for force or guile,  
Or some religious end, you rais’d the pile?’  
Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,  
This well-invented tale for truth imparts:  
‘Ye lamps of heav’n!’ he said, and lifted high  
His hands now free, ‘thou venerable sky!  
Inviolable pow’rs, ador’d with dread!  
Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!  
Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!  
Be all of you adjur’d; and grant I may,  
Without a crime, th’ ungrateful Greeks betray,  
Reveal the secrets of the guilty state, </pre></div> </div>
