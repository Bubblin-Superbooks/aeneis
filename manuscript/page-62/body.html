You, who your pious offices employ  
To save the relics of abandon’d Troy;  
Receive the shipwreck’d on your friendly shore,  
With hospitable rites relieve the poor;  
Associate in your town a wand’ring train,  
And strangers in your palace entertain:  
What thanks can wretched fugitives return,  
Who, scatter’d thro’ the world, in exile mourn?  
The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin’d;  
If acts of mercy touch their heav’nly mind,  
And, more than all the gods, your gen’rous heart.  
Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!  
In you this age is happy, and this earth,  
And parents more than mortal gave you birth.  
While rolling rivers into seas shall run,  
And round the space of heav’n the radiant sun;  
While trees the mountain tops with shades supply, </pre></div> </div>
