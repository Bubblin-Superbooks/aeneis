That boiling blood would carry thee too far,  
Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!  
O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,  
Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!  
Hard elements of unauspicious war,  
Vain vows to Heav’n, and unavailing care!  
Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,  
Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,  
Prescious of ills, and leaving me behind,  
To drink the dregs of life by fate assign’d!  
Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:  
My Pallas late set out, but reach’d too soon.  
If, for my league against th’ Ausonian state,  
Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,  
(Deserv’d from them,) then I had been return’d  
A breathless victor, and my son had mourn’d.  
Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid, </pre></div> </div>
