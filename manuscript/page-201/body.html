As Helenus enjoin’d, we next adore  
Diana’s name, protectress of the shore.  
With prosp’rous gales we pass the quiet sounds  
Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds.  
Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey  
The rocky shore extended to the sea.  
The town of Camarine from far we see,  
And fenny lake, undrain’d by fate’s decree.  
In sight of the Geloan fields we pass,  
And the large walls, where mighty Gela was;  
Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown’d,  
Long for the race of warlike steeds renown’d.  
We pass’d Selinus, and the palmy land,  
And widely shun the Lilybaean strand,  
Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand.  
At length on shore the weary fleet arriv’d,  
Which Drepanum’s unhappy port receiv’d. </pre></div> </div>
