Mix’d with the first, the fierce Virago fought,  
Sustain’d the toils of arms, the danger sought,  
Outstripp’d the winds in speed upon the plain,  
Flew o’er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:  
She swept the seas, and, as she skimm’d along,  
Her flying feet unbath’d on billows hung.  
Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,  
Where’er she passes, fix their wond’ring eyes:  
Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight,  
Devour her o’er and o’er with vast delight;  
Her purple habit sits with such a grace  
On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;  
Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown’d,  
And in a golden caul the curls are bound.  
She shakes her myrtle jav’lin; and, behind,  
Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
