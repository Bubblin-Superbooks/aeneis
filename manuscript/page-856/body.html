Engag’d against my foes in mortal fight.  
’Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife  
By my command, to save her brother’s life,  
At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,  
(The most religious oath the gods can take,)  
With this restriction, not to bend the bow,  
Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.  
And now, resign’d to your superior might,  
And tir’d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.  
This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)  
Both for myself and for your father’s land,  
That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,  
(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)  
The laws of either nation be the same;  
But let the Latins still retain their name,  
Speak the same language which they spoke before,  
Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore. </pre></div> </div>
