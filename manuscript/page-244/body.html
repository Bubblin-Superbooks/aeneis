Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,  
And bandied words, still beating on his ears.  
Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;  
But the firm purpose of his heart remains.  

The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,  
Begins at length the light of heav’n to hate,  
And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,  
To hasten on the death her soul decrees:  
Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,

The purple wine is turn’d to putrid blood,  
And the white offer’d milk converts to mud.

From all, and ev’n her sister, she conceal’d.  
A marble temple stood within the grove,  
Sacred to death, and to her murder’d love; </pre></div> </div>
