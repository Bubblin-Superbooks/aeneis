Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,  
And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;  
Dragg’d in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,  
Hot from the vexing ir’n, and smear’d with fragrant oil!”  

Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies  
A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.  
So fares the bull in his lov’d female’s sight:  
Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;  
He tries his goring horns against a tree,  
And meditates his absent enemy;  
He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand  
With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.  

Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,  
To future fight his manly courage warms: </pre></div> </div>
