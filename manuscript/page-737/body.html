The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,  
I was not forc’d with ease to quit my ground.  
Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos’d,  
I singly their united arms oppos’d:  
First forc’d an entrance thro’ their thick array;  
Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.  
’Tis a destructive war? So let it be,  
But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!  
Meantime proceed to fill the people’s ears  
With false reports, their minds with panic fears:  
Extol the strength of a twice-conquer’d race;  
Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.  
Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town  
Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o’erthrown;  
Suppliant at Hector’s feet Achilles lies,  
And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.  
Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread </pre></div> </div>
