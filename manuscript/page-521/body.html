Arms for a hero forge; arms that require  
Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire.”  
He said. They set their former work aside,  
And their new toils with eager haste divide.  
A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,  
And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll’d;  
Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,  
Alone sufficient to sustain the war.  
Sev’n orbs within a spacious round they close:  
One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.  
The hissing steel is in the smithy drown’d;  
The grot with beaten anvils groans around.  
By turns their arms advance, in equal time;  
By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.  
They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;  
The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs. </pre></div> </div>
