And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;  
And, while the priests with pray’r the gods invoke,  
She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke,  
With hourly care the sacrifice renews,  
And anxiously the panting entrails views.  
What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,  
What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!  
A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,  
Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.

From street to street the raving Dido roves.  
So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,  
Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,  
Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,  
Bounds o’er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,  
With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart </pre></div> </div>
