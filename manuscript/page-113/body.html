With Pelias wounded, and without defence.  
New clamours from th’ invested palace ring:  
We run to die, or disengage the king.  
So hot th’ assault, so high the tumult rose,  
While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose  
As all the Dardan and Argolic race  
Had been contracted in that narrow space;  
Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,  
And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.  
Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,  
Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:  
Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,  
Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;  
Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th’ ascent,  
While with their right they seize the battlement.  
From their demolish’d tow’rs the Trojans throw  
Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; </pre></div> </div>
