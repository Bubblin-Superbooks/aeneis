Of all the Greeks, and most renown’d by fame,  
The proud revenger of another’s wife,  
Yet by his own adult’ress lost his life;  
Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy  
The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.  
The gods have envied me the sweets of life,  
My much lov’d country, and my more lov’d wife:  
Banish’d from both, I mourn; while in the sky,  
Transform’d to birds, my lost companions fly:  
Hov’ring about the coasts, they make their moan,  
And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.  
What squalid spectres, in the dead of night,  
Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!  
I might have promis’d to myself those harms,  
Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,  
Presum’d against immortal pow’rs to move,  
And violate with wounds the Queen of Love. </pre></div> </div>
