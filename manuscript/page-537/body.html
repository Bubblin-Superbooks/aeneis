Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.  
The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,  
For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.  
Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;  
The Romans there with arms the prey defend.  
Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;  
And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.  
The friendly chiefs before Jove’s altar stand,  
Both arm’d, with each a charger in his hand:  
A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,  
With imprecations on the perjur’d head.  
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch’d between  
Four fiery steeds, is dragg’d along the green,  
By Tullus’ doom: the brambles drink his blood,  
And his torn limbs are left the vulture’s food.  
There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,  
And would by force restore the banish’d kings. </pre></div> </div>
