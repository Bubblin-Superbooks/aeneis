But if the challenger these arms refuse,  
And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;  
If great Aeneas and Acestes join  
In his request, these gauntlets I resign;  
Let us with equal arms perform the fight,  
And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.”  

This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;  
Stripp’d of his quilted coat, his body bares;  
Compos’d of mighty bones and brawn he stands,  
A goodly tow’ring object on the sands.  
Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,  
Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.  
Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,  
Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;  
Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;  
With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war. </pre></div> </div>
