A cloud of blinding dust is rais’d around,  
Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground.  

Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far  
Beheld the progress of the moving war:  
With him the Latins view’d the cover’d plains,  
And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.  
Juturna saw th’ advancing troops appear,  
And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.  
Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,  
Clos’d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.  
As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore  
From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;  
The painful hind with heavy heart foresees  
The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;  
With like impetuous rage the prince appears  
Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. </pre></div> </div>
