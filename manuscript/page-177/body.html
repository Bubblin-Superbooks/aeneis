For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits  
Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way,  
Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:  
Veer starboard sea and land. Th’ Italian shore  
And fair Sicilia’s coast were one, before  
An earthquake caus’d the flaw: the roaring tides  
The passage broke that land from land divides;  
And where the lands retir’d, the rushing ocean rides.  
Distinguish’d by the straits, on either hand,  
Now rising cities in long order stand,  
And fruitful fields: so much can time invade  
The mould’ring work that beauteous Nature made.  
Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides:  
Charybdis roaring on the left presides,  
And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides;  
Then spouts them from below: with fury driv’n,  
The waves mount up and wash the face of heav’n. </pre></div> </div>
