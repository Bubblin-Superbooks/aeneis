Involv’d in clouds, and vanish’d out of sight.  

The pious prince was seiz’d with sudden fear;  
Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.  
Revolving in his mind the stern command,  
He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.  
What should he say? or how should he begin?  
What course, alas! remains to steer between  
Th’ offended lover and the pow’rful queen?  
This way and that he turns his anxious mind,  
And all expedients tries, and none can find.  
Fix’d on the deed, but doubtful of the means,  
After long thought, to this advice he leans:  
Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair  
The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;  
Some plausible pretence he bids them find,  
To colour what in secret he design’d. </pre></div> </div>
