He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;  
The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.  
He look’d in years; yet in his years were seen  
A youthful vigour and autumnal green.  
An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,  
Which fill’d the margin of the fatal flood:  
Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,  
And mighty heroes’ more majestic shades,  
And youths, intomb’d before their fathers’ eyes,  
With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.  
Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,  
Or fowls, by winter forc’d, forsake the floods,  
And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;  
Such, and so thick, the shiv’ring army stands,  
And press for passage with extended hands.  
Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:  
The rest he drove to distance from the shore. </pre></div> </div>
