To seek for needful succour from without?  
If Jove and Heav’n my just desires deny,  
Hell shall the pow’r of Heav’n and Jove supply.  
Grant that the Fates have firm’d, by their decree,  
The Trojan race to reign in Italy;  
At least I can defer the nuptial day,  
And with protracted wars the peace delay:  
With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,  
And both the people near destruction brought;  
So shall the son-in-law and father join,  
With ruin, war, and waste of either line.  
O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow’d  
With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!  
Bellona leads thee to thy lover’s hand;  
Another queen brings forth another brand,  
To burn with foreign fires another land!  
A second Paris, diff’ring but in name, </pre></div> </div>
