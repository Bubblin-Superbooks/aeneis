For murder’d Lausus, on his cruel foe;  
Or, if inexorable fate deny  
Our conquest, with thy conquer’d master die:  
For, after such a lord, I rest secure,  
Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.”  
He said; and straight th’ officious courser kneels,  
To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills  
With pointed jav’lins; on his head he lac’d  
His glitt’ring helm, which terribly was grac’d  
With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;  
Then spurr’d his thund’ring steed amidst the war.  
Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,  
Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought  
Of inborn worth, his lab’ring soul oppress’d,  
Roll’d in his eyes, and rag’d within his breast.  
Then loud he call’d Aeneas thrice by name:  
The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came. </pre></div> </div>
