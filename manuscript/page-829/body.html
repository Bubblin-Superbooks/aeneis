Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill’d,  
Who long had shunn’d the dangers of the field:  
On Lerna’s lake a silent life he led,  
And with his nets and angle earn’d his bread;  
Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,  
But wisely from th’ infectious world withdrew:  
Poor was his house; his father’s painful hand  
Discharg’d his rent, and plow’d another’s land.  

As flames among the lofty woods are thrown  
On diff’rent sides, and both by winds are blown;  
The laurels crackle in the sputt’ring fire;  
The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:  
Or as two neighb’ring torrents fall from high;  
Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;  
They roll to sea with unresisted force,  
And down the rocks precipitate their course: </pre></div> </div>
