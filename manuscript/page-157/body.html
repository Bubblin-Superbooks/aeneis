Again my father bids me seek the shore  
Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,  
To learn what end of woes we might expect,  
And to what clime our weary course direct.  

“’Twas night, when ev’ry creature, void of cares,  
The common gift of balmy slumber shares:  
The statues of my gods (for such they seem’d),  
Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem’d,  
Before me stood, majestically bright,  
Full in the beams of Phoebe’s ent’ring light.  
Then thus they spoke, and eas’d my troubled mind:  
‘What from the Delian god thou go’st to find,  
He tells thee here, and sends us to relate.  
Those pow’rs are we, companions of thy fate,  
Who from the burning town by thee were brought,  
Thy fortune follow’d, and thy safety wrought. </pre></div> </div>
