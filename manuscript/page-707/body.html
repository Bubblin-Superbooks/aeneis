Of Latian leaders conquer’d by the dead.  

Acoetes on his pupil’s corpse attends,  
With feeble steps, supported by his friends.  
Pausing at ev’ry pace, in sorrow drown’d,  
Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;  
Where grov’ling while he lies in deep despair,  
He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.  
The champion’s chariot next is seen to roll,  
Besmear’d with hostile blood, and honourably foul.  
To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,  
Is led, the fun’rals of his lord to wait.  
Stripp’d of his trappings, with a sullen pace  
He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.  
The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,  
Are borne behind: the victor seiz’d the rest.  
The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound; </pre></div> </div>
