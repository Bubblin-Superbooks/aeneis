Let him not pass unpunish’d from the plain.  
Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid  
To bear the breathless body of my maid:  
Unspoil’d shall be her arms, and unprofan’d  
Her holy limbs with any human hand,  
And in a marble tomb laid in her native land.”  

She said. The faithful nymph descends from high  
With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:  
Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.  

By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,  
Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,  
Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,  
Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.  
Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;  
And the fields glitter with a waving war. </pre></div> </div>
