Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.  
Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,  
And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.  
And that this nightly vision may not seem  
Th’ effect of fancy, or an idle dream,  
A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,  
All white herself, and white her thirty young.  
When thirty rolling years have run their race,  
Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,  
Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,  
Which from this omen shall receive the name.  
Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,  
And how with sure success to crown thy pains,  
With patience next attend. A banish’d band,  
Driv’n with Evander from th’ Arcadian land,  
Have planted here, and plac’d on high their walls;  
Their town the founder Pallanteum calls, </pre></div> </div>
