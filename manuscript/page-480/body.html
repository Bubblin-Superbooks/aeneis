By King Archippus sent to Turnus’ aid,  
And peaceful olives crown’d his hoary head.  
His wand and holy words, the viper’s rage,  
And venom’d wounds of serpents could assuage.  
He, when he pleas’d with powerful juice to steep  
Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.  
But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,  
To cure the wound giv’n by the Dardan dart:  
Yet his untimely fate th’ Angitian woods  
In sighs remurmur’d to the Fucine floods.  

The son of fam’d Hippolytus was there,  
Fam’d as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;  
Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,  
And nurs’d his youth along the marshy shore,  
Where great Diana’s peaceful altars flame,  
In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name. </pre></div> </div>
