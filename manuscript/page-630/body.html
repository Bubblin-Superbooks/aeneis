Thus mortal war was wag’d on either side.  
Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:  
For, anxious, from Evander when he went,  
He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon’s tent;  
Expos’d the cause of coming to the chief;  
His name and country told, and ask’d relief;  
Propos’d the terms; his own small strength declar’d;  
What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar’d:  
What Turnus, bold and violent, design’d;  
Then shew’d the slipp’ry state of humankind,  
And fickle fortune; warn’d him to beware,  
And to his wholesome counsel added pray’r.  
Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs,  
And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.  

They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand; </pre></div> </div>
