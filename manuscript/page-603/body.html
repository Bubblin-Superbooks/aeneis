Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;  
And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.  
The combat thickens, like the storm that flies  
From westward, when the show’ry Kids arise;  
Or patt’ring hail comes pouring on the main,  
When Jupiter descends in harden’d rain,  
Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,  
And with an armed winter strew the ground.  

Pand’rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,  
Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare  
On Ida’s top, two youths of height and size  
Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,  
Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,  
And of their own accord invite the war.  
With fates averse, against their king’s command,  
Arm’d, on the right and on the left they stand, </pre></div> </div>
