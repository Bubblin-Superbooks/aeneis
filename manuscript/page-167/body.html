Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay  
To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.  
The customs of our country we pursue,  
And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.  
Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,  
And exercise the wrastlers’ noble toil;  
Pleas’d to have sail’d so long before the wind,  
And left so many Grecian towns behind.  
The sun had now fulfill’d his annual course,  
And Boreas on the seas display’d his force:  
I fix’d upon the temple’s lofty door  
The brazen shield which vanquish’d Abas bore;  
The verse beneath my name and action speaks:  
‘These arms Aeneas took from conqu’ring Greeks.’  
Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply  
Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.  
The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost, </pre></div> </div>
