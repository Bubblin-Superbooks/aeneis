’Tis true, computing times, I now believ’d  
The happy day approach’d; nor are my hopes deceiv’d.  
What length of lands, what oceans have you pass’d;  
What storms sustain’d, and on what shores been cast?  
How have I fear’d your fate! but fear’d it most,  
When love assail’d you, on the Libyan coast.”  
To this, the filial duty thus replies:  
“Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes  
Appear’d, and often urg’d this painful enterprise.  
After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,  
My navy rides at anchor in the bay.  
But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun  
The dear embraces of your longing son!”  
He said; and falling tears his face bedew:  
Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;  
And thrice the flitting shadow slipp’d away,  
Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day. </pre></div> </div>
