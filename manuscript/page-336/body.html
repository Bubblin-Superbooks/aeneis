Shall I believe the Siren South again,  
And, oft betray’d, not know the monster main?”  
He said: his fasten’d hands the rudder keep,  
And, fix’d on heav’n, his eyes repel invading sleep.  
The god was wroth, and at his temples threw  
A branch in Lethe dipp’d, and drunk with Stygian dew:  
The pilot, vanquish’d by the pow’r divine,  
Soon clos’d his swimming eyes, and lay supine.  
Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,  
The god, insulting with superior strength,  
Fell heavy on him, plung’d him in the sea,  
And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.  
Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,  
Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.  
The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,  
While the ship sails without the pilot’s care. </pre></div> </div>
