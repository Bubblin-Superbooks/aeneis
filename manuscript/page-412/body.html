All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound:  
But hov’ring mists around his brows are spread,  
And night, with sable shades, involves his head.”  
“Seek not to know,” the ghost replied with tears,  
“The sorrows of thy sons in future years.  
This youth (the blissful vision of a day)  
Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch’d away.  
The gods too high had rais’d the Roman state,  
Were but their gifts as permanent as great.  
What groans of men shall fill the Martian field!  
How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield!  
What fun’ral pomp shall floating Tiber see,  
When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity!  
No youth shall equal hopes of glory give,  
No youth afford so great a cause to grieve;  
The Trojan honour, and the Roman boast,  
Admir’d when living, and ador’d when lost! </pre></div> </div>
