Your ship should run against the rocky coast.  
Three blust’ring nights, borne by the southern blast,  
I floated, and discover’d land at last:  
High on a mounting wave my head I bore,  
Forcing my strength, and gath’ring to the shore.  
Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz’d  
The craggy cliffs, and my tir’d members eas’d.  
While, cumber’d with my dropping clothes, I lay,  
The cruel nation, covetous of prey,  
Stain’d with my blood th’ unhospitable coast;  
And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss’d:  
Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,  
Which I have lost for this eternal night!  
Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,  
By your dead sire, and by your living son,  
Redeem from this reproach my wand’ring ghost; </pre></div> </div>
