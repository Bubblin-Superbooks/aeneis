The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,  
Forc’d by the winged warriors to repair  
To their old homes, and leave their costly fare.  
Monsters more fierce offended Heav’n ne’er sent  
From hell’s abyss, for human punishment:  
With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,  
Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;  
With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean.  

“We landed at the port, and soon beheld  
Fat herds of oxen graze the flow’ry field,  
And wanton goats without a keeper stray’d.  
With weapons we the welcome prey invade,  
Then call the gods for partners of our feast,  
And Jove himself, the chief invited guest.  
We spread the tables on the greensward ground;  
We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round; </pre></div> </div>
