But in a bull’s raw hide they sheathe the right.  
Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)  
Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,  
In pomp appears, and with his ardour warms  
A heartless train, unexercis’d in arms:  
The just Faliscans he to battle brings,  
And those who live where Lake Ciminius springs;  
And where Feronia’s grove and temple stands,  
Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands.  
All these in order march, and marching sing  
The warlike actions of their sea-born king;  
Like a long team of snowy swans on high,  
Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,  
When, homeward from their wat’ry pastures borne,  
They sing, and Asia’s lakes their notes return.  
Not one who heard their music from afar,  
Would think these troops an army train’d to war, </pre></div> </div>
