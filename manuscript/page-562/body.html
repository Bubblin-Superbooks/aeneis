Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied  
A way that safely will my passage guide.”  

Euryalus stood list’ning while he spoke,  
With love of praise and noble envy struck;  
Then to his ardent friend expos’d his mind:  
“All this, alone, and leaving me behind!  
Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join’d?  
Think’st thou I can my share of glory yield,  
Or send thee unassisted to the field?  
Not so my father taught my childhood arms;  
Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!  
Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,  
Nor of the heav’n-born hero I attend.  
The thing call’d life, with ease I can disclaim,  
And think it over-sold to purchase fame.” </pre></div> </div>
