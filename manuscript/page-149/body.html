“My falt’ring tongue and shiv’ring limbs declare  
My horror, and in bristles rose my hair.  
When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,  
Old Priam, fearful of the war’s event,  
This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:  
Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far  
From noise and tumults, and destructive war,  
Committed to the faithless tyrant’s care;  
Who, when he saw the pow’r of Troy decline,  
Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;  
Broke ev’ry bond of nature and of truth,  
And murder’d, for his wealth, the royal youth.

I call my father and the Trojan peers; </pre></div> </div>
