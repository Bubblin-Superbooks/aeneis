Not far from hence, if I observ’d aright  
The southing of the stars, and polar light,  
Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores  
In safety we may reach with struggling oars.”  
Aeneas then replied: “Too sure I find  
We strive in vain against the seas and wind:  
Now shift your sails; what place can please me more  
Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,  
Whose hallow’d earth Anchises’ bones contains,  
And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?”  
The course resolv’d, before the western wind  
They scud amain, and make the port assign’d.  
Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,  
Beheld the fleet descending on the land;  
And, not unmindful of his ancient race,  
Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,  
And held the hero in a strict embrace. </pre></div> </div>
