Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare  
To join th’ allies, and headlong rush to war.  
Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,  
With bold Mezentius, who blasphem’d aloud.  
These thro’ the country took their wasteful course,  
The fields to forage, and to gather force.  
Then Venulus to Diomede they send,  
To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,  
Declare the common danger, and inform  
The Grecian leader of the growing storm:  
“Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,  
With banish’d gods, and with a baffled host,  
Yet now aspir’d to conquest of the state,  
And claim’d a title from the gods and fate;  
What num’rous nations in his quarrel came,  
And how they spread his formidable name.  
What he design’d, what mischief might arise, </pre></div> </div>
