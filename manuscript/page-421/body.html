But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew  
His birth from Saturn, if records be true.  
Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,  
Had Saturn author of his family.  
But this old peaceful prince, as Heav’n decreed,  
Was blest with no male issue to succeed:  
His sons in blooming youth were snatch’d by fate;  
One only daughter heir’d the royal state.  
Fir’d with her love, and with ambition led,  
The neighb’ring princes court her nuptial bed.  
Among the crowd, but far above the rest,  
Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address’d.  
Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,  
Was first, and favour’d by the Latian queen;  
With him she strove to join Lavinia’s hand,  
But dire portents the purpos’d match withstand. </pre></div> </div>
