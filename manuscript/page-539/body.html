And golden chains on their white necks they wear.  
Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,  
And their left arm sustains a length of shield.  
Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;  
And naked thro’ the streets the mad Luperci dance,  
In caps of wool; the targets dropp’d from heav’n.  
Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv’n,  
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,  
And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.  
Far hence remov’d, the Stygian seats are seen;  
Pains of the damn’d, and punish’d Catiline  
Hung on a rock—the traitor; and, around,  
The Furies hissing from the nether ground.  
Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,  
And Cato’s holy ghost dispensing laws.  

Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea; </pre></div> </div>
