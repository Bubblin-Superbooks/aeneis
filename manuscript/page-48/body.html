Their lofty tow’rs; then, ent’ring at the gate,  
Conceal’d in clouds (prodigious to relate)  
He mix’d, unmark’d, among the busy throng,  
Borne by the tide, and pass’d unseen along.  

Full in the centre of the town there stood,  
Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.  
The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,  
And digging here, a prosp’rous omen found:  
From under earth a courser’s head they drew,  
Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.  
This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,  
Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.  
Sidonian Dido here with solemn state  
Did Juno’s temple build, and consecrate,  
Enrich’d with gifts, and with a golden shrine;  
But more the goddess made the place divine. </pre></div> </div>
