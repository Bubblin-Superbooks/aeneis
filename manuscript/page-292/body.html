But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,  
And Salius his from Arcananian earth;  
Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these,  
Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:  
Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,  
And owning old Acestes for their head;  
With sev’ral others of ignobler name,  
Whom time has not deliver’d o’er to fame.  

To these the hero thus his thoughts explain’d,  
In words which gen’ral approbation gain’d:  
“One common largess is for all design’d,  
The vanquish’d and the victor shall be join’d,  
Two darts of polish’d steel and Gnosian wood,  
A silver-studded ax alike bestow’d.  
The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:  
The first of these obtains a stately steed, </pre></div> </div>
