His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,  
Had won, or left at least a dubious race.  

Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,  
When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,  
Slipp’d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,  
Soak’d with the blood of oxen newly slain.  
The careless victor had not mark’d his way;  
But, treading where the treach’rous puddle lay,  
His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor  
He fell, besmear’d with filth and holy gore.  
Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,  
Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,  
He strove th’ immediate rival’s hope to cross,  
And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.  
So Salius lay extended on the plain;  
Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, </pre></div> </div>
