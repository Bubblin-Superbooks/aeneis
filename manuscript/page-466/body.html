To force their monarch, and insult the court.  
But, like a rock unmov’d, a rock that braves  
The raging tempest and the rising waves,  
Propp’d on himself he stands; his solid sides  
Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides:  
So stood the pious prince, unmov’d, and long  
Sustain’d the madness of the noisy throng.  
But, when he found that Juno’s pow’r prevail’d,  
And all the methods of cool counsel fail’d,  
He calls the gods to witness their offence,  
Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.  
“Hurried by fate,” he cries, “and borne before  
A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.  
O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear  
The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:  
Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,  
And pray to Heav’n for peace, but pray too late. </pre></div> </div>
