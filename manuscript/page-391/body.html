The walls of Pluto’s palace are in view;  
The gate, and iron arch above it, stands  
On anvils labour’d by the Cyclops’ hands.  
Before our farther way the Fates allow,  
Here must we fix on high the golden bough.”  

She said, and thro’ the gloomy shades they pass’d,  
And chose the middle path. Arriv’d at last,  
The prince with living water sprinkled o’er  
His limbs and body; then approach’d the door,  
Possess’d the porch, and on the front above  
He fix’d the fatal bough requir’d by Pluto’s love.  
These holy rites perform’d, they took their way  
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:  
The verdant fields with those of heav’n may vie,  
With ether vested, and a purple sky;  
The blissful seats of happy souls below. </pre></div> </div>
