Thro’ seas and lands as we thy steps attend,  
So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.  
An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,  
A town that o’er the conquer’d world shall reign.  
Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;  
Nor let thy weary mind to labours yield:  
But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,  
Nor we, have giv’n thee Crete for our abode.  
A land there is, Hesperia call’d of old,  
The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold.  
Th’ Oenotrians held it once, by later fame  
Now call’d Italia, from the leader’s name.  
Jasius there and Dardanus were born;  
From thence we came, and thither must return.  
Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.  
Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.’ </pre></div> </div>
