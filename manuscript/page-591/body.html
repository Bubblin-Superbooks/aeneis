Still gath’ring fast upon the trembling train;  
Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,  
Down the defence and the defenders fall.  
The mighty flaw makes heav’n itself resound:  
The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.  
The tow’r, that follow’d on the fallen crew,  
Whelm’d o’er their heads, and buried whom it slew:  
Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;  
All the same equal ruin underwent.  

Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;  
Sav’d—how, they know not—from the steepy leap.  
Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,  
On one side royal, one a son of earth,  
Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,  
And sent her boasted bastard to the war  
(A privilege which none but freemen share). </pre></div> </div>
