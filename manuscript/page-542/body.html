Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love’s Queen defy:  
The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,  
Nor longer dares oppose th’ ethereal train.  
Mars in the middle of the shining shield  
Is grav’d, and strides along the liquid field.  
The Dirae souse from heav’n with swift descent;  
And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent,  
Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads,  
And shakes her iron rod above their heads.  
This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,  
Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight  
The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield,  
And soft Sabaeans quit the wat’ry field.  
The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,  
And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.  
Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,  
Panting, and pale with fear of future death. </pre></div> </div>
