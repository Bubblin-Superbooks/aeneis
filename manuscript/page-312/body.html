On horseback let him grace his grandsire’s day,  
And lead his equals arm’d in just array.”  
He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.  
The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.  
And now the noble youths, of form divine,  
Advance before their fathers, in a line;  
The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.  

Thus marching on in military pride,  
Shouts of applause resound from side to side.  
Their casques adorn’d with laurel wreaths they wear,  
Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.  
Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;  
Their chains of burnish’d gold hung down before.  
Three graceful troops they form’d upon the green;  
Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;  
Twelve follow’d ev’ry chief, and left a space between. </pre></div> </div>
