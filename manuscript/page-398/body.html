In Lethe’s lake they long oblivion taste,  
Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.  
Long has my soul desir’d this time and place,  
To set before your sight your glorious race,  
That this presaging joy may fire your mind  
To seek the shores by destiny design’d.”  
“O father, can it be, that souls sublime  
Return to visit our terrestrial clime,  
And that the gen’rous mind, releas’d by death,  
Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?”  

Anchises then, in order, thus begun  
To clear those wonders to his godlike son:  
“Know, first, that heav’n, and earth’s compacted frame,  
And flowing waters, and the starry flame,  
And both the radiant lights, one common soul </pre></div> </div>
