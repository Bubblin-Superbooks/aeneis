But held his hand from the descending stroke,  
And left his wedge within the cloven oak,  
To whet their courage and their rage provoke.  
And now the goddess, exercis’d in ill,  
Who watch’d an hour to work her impious will,  
Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,  
Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,  
Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around,  
And mountains, tremble at th’ infernal sound.  
The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,  
The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,  
Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.  
Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess’d,  
And strain their helpless infants to their breast.  

The clowns, a boist’rous, rude, ungovern’d crew,  
With furious haste to the loud summons flew. </pre></div> </div>
