Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.  
But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,  
Come rolling on, and rush from ev’ry side:  
Nor Juno, who sustain’d his arms before,  
Dares with new strength suffice th’ exhausted store;  
For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,  
To force th’ invader from the frighted town.  

With labour spent, no longer can he wield  
The heavy falchion, or sustain the shield,  
O’erwhelm’d with darts, which from afar they fling:  
The weapons round his hollow temples ring;  
His golden helm gives way, with stony blows  
Batter’d, and flat, and beaten to his brows.  
His crest is rash’d away; his ample shield  
Is falsified, and round with jav’lins fill’d. </pre></div> </div>
