The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac’d,  
Herself suborning death, has breath’d her last.  
’Tis true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,  
With fierce Atinas’ aid, defends the gate:  
On ev’ry side surrounded by the foe,  
The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;  
An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.  
You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,  
Your rolling chariot drive o’er empty sands.  

Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin’d,  
And various cares revolving in his mind:  
Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,  
And sorrow mix’d with shame, his soul oppress’d;  
And conscious worth lay lab’ring in his thought,  
And love by jealousy to madness wrought.  
By slow degrees his reason drove away </pre></div> </div>
