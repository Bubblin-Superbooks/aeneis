The flying spear was after Ilus sent;  
But Rhoeteus happen’d on a death unmeant:  
From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,  
The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:  
Roll’d from his chariot with a mortal wound,  
And intercepted fate, he spurn’d the ground.  
As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,  
The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,  
And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,  
And catching flames infect the neighb’ring heads;  
Around the forest flies the furious blast,  
And all the leafy nation sinks at last,  
And Vulcan rides in triumph o’er the waste;  
The pastor, pleas’d with his dire victory,  
Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:  
So Pallas’ troops their scatter’d strength unite,  
And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight. </pre></div> </div>
