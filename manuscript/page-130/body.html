These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;  
At least the pitying foes will aid my death,  
To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:  
As for my sepulcher, let Heav’n take care.  
’Tis long since I, for my celestial wife  
Loath’d by the gods, have dragg’d a ling’ring life;  
Since ev’ry hour and moment I expire,  
Blasted from heav’n by Jove’s avenging fire.’  
This oft repeated, he stood fix’d to die:  
Myself, my wife, my son, my family,  
Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry.  
‘What, will he still persist, on death resolve,  
And in his ruin all his house involve!’  
He still persists his reasons to maintain;  
Our pray’rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain.
