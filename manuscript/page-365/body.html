The hero, who beheld with wond’ring eyes  
The tumult mix’d with shrieks, laments, and cries,  
Ask’d of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;  
Why to the shore the thronging people bent;  
What forms of law among the ghosts were us’d;  
Why some were ferried o’er, and some refus’d.  

“Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,”  
The Sibyl said, “you see the Stygian floods,  
The sacred stream which heav’n’s imperial state  
Attests in oaths, and fears to violate.  
The ghosts rejected are th’ unhappy crew  
Depriv’d of sepulchers and fun’ral due:  
The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,  
He ferries over to the farther coast;  
Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves  
With such whose bones are not compos’d in graves. </pre></div> </div>
