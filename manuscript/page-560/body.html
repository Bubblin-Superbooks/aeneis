The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,  
By turns relieve each other on the wall.  

Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,  
To watch the gate was warlike Nisus’ chance.  
His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;  
His mother was a huntress of the wood,  
And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear  
His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,  
But better skill’d unerring shafts to send.  
Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:  
Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host  
No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast.  
Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.  
One was their care, and their delight was one:  
One common hazard in the war they shar’d,  
And now were both by choice upon the guard. </pre></div> </div>
