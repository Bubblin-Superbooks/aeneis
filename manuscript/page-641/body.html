Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent  
To man the shores, and hinder their descent,  
And thus awakes the courage of his friends:  
“What you so long have wish’d, kind Fortune sends;  
In ardent arms to meet th’ invading foe:  
You find, and find him at advantage now.  
Yours is the day: you need but only dare;  
Your swords will make you masters of the war.  
Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,  
And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.  
Be mindful of the race from whence you came,  
And emulate in arms your fathers’ fame.  
Now take the time, while stagg’ring yet they stand  
With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:  
Fortune befriends the bold.” Nor more he said,  
But balanc’d whom to leave, and whom to lead; </pre></div> </div>
