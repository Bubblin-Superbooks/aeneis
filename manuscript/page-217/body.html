Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;  
A golden fillet binds his awful brows;  
His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen  
In manly presence, or in lofty mien.  

Now had they reach’d the hills, and storm’d the seat  
Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.  
The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound  
From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;  
Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,  
In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,  
And a long chase in open view maintain.  
The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,  
Spurs thro’ the vale, and these and those outrides.  
His horse’s flanks and sides are forc’d to feel  
The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.  
Impatiently he views the feeble prey, </pre></div> </div>
