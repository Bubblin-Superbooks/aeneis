They wind the hill, and thro’ the blissful meadows go.  

But old Anchises, in a flow’ry vale,  
Review’d his muster’d race, and took the tale:  
Those happy spirits, which, ordain’d by fate,  
For future beings and new bodies wait.  
With studious thought observ’d th’ illustrious throng,  
In nature’s order as they pass’d along:  
Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,  
In peaceful senates and successful war.  
He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,  
Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.  
“Welcome,” he said, “the gods’ undoubted race!  
O long expected to my dear embrace!  
Once more ’tis giv’n me to behold your face!  
The love and pious duty which you pay  
Have pass’d the perils of so hard a way. </pre></div> </div>
