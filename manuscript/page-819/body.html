He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.  
Then to the patron of his art he pray’d:  
The patron of his art refus’d his aid.  

Meantime the war approaches to the tents;  
Th’ alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:  
The driving dust proclaims the danger near;  
And first their friends, and then their foes appear:  
Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.  
The camp is fill’d with terror and affright:  
The hissing shafts within the trench alight;  
An undistinguish’d noise ascends the sky,  
The shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die.  

But now the goddess mother, mov’d with grief,  
And pierc’d with pity, hastens her relief. </pre></div> </div>
