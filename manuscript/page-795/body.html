“O nymph, the pride of living lakes,” said she,  
“O most renown’d, and most belov’d by me,  
Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,  
The wanton sallies of my wand’ring lord.  
Of ev’ry Latian fair whom Jove misled  
To mount by stealth my violated bed,  
To thee alone I grudg’d not his embrace,  
But gave a part of heav’n, and an unenvied place.  
Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,  
Nor think my wishes want to thy relief.  
While fortune favour’d, nor Heav’n’s King denied  
To lend my succour to the Latian side,  
I sav’d thy brother, and the sinking state:  
But now he struggles with unequal fate,  
And goes, with gods averse, o’ermatch’d in might,  
To meet inevitable death in fight;  
Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. </pre></div> </div>
