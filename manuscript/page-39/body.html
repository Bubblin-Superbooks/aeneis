Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are:  
A people rude in peace, and rough in war.  
The rising city, which from far you see,  
Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.  
Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,  
Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother’s hate.  
Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;  
Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known  
For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,  
Possess’d fair Dido’s bed; and either heart  
At once was wounded with an equal dart.  
Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;  
Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway’d:  
One who condemn’d divine and human laws.  
Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.  
The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,  
With steel invades his brother’s life by stealth; </pre></div> </div>
