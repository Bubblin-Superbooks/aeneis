“Undaunted prince, I never can believe  
The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.  
Command th’ assistance of a faithful friend;  
But feeble are the succours I can send.  
Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;  
That other side the Latian state surrounds,  
Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.  
But mighty nations I prepare, to join  
Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.  
You come, as by your better genius sent,  
And fortune seems to favour your intent.  
Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,  
Of ancient building, and of high renown,  
Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,  
Who gave the name of Caere to the place,  
Once Agyllina call’d. It flourish’d long,  
In pride of wealth and warlike people strong, </pre></div> </div>
