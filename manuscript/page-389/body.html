Then they, who brothers’ better claim disown,  
Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;  
Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,  
Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;  
Who dare not give, and ev’n refuse to lend  
To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.  
Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train  
Of lustful youths, for foul adult’ry slain:  
Hosts of deserters, who their honour sold,  
And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.  
All these within the dungeon’s depth remain,  
Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.  
Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know  
Their process, or the forms of law below.  
Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,  
And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung </pre></div> </div>
