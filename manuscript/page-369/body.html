Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,  
And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;  
Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,  
Without whose aid you durst not undertake  
This frightful passage o’er the Stygian lake,  
Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o’er  
To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.”  
Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:  
“What hopes delude thee, miserable man?  
Think’st thou, thus unintomb’d, to cross the floods,  
To view the Furies and infernal gods,  
And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?  
Attend the term of long revolving years;  
Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.  
This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:  
The wrath of Heav’n, inflicted for thy sake,  
With vengeance shall pursue th’ inhuman coast, </pre></div> </div>
