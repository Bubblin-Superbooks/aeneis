The steeds of Night had travel’d half the sky,  
The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,  
When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,  
Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.  
Thou, Palinurus, art his destin’d prey;  
To thee alone he takes his fatal way.  
Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;  
And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.  
Then thus the traitor god began his tale:  
“The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;  
The ships, without thy care, securely sail.  
Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I  
Will take the rudder and thy room supply.”  
To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:  
“Me dost thou bid to trust the treach’rous deep,  
The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,  
And to her faith commit the Trojan race? </pre></div> </div>
