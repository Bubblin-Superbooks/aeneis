Drive down this body to the nether sky,  
Condemn’d with ghosts in endless night to lie,  
Before I break the plighted faith I gave!  
No! he who had my vows shall ever have;  
For, whom I lov’d on earth, I worship in the grave.”  

She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes,  
And stopp’d her speech. Her sister thus replies:  
“O dearer than the vital air I breathe,  
Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath,  
Condemn’d to waste in woes your lonely life,  
Without the joys of mother or of wife?  
Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,  
Are known or valued by the ghosts below?  
I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green,  
It well became a woman, and a queen,  
The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect, </pre></div> </div>
