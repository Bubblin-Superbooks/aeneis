To Ceres hallow’d once; a cypress nigh  
Shoots up her venerable head on high,  
By long religion kept; there bend your feet,  
And in divided parties let us meet.  
Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,  
Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:  
In me ’tis impious holy things to bear,  
Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,  
Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt  
Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.’  
Thus, ord’ring all that prudence could provide,  
I clothe my shoulders with a lion’s hide  
And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,  
The welcome load of my dear father take;  
While on my better hand Ascanius hung,  
And with unequal paces tripp’d along.  
Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray </pre></div> </div>
