Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,  
Mix’d in the woods, for fun’ral piles prepare  
To fell the timber, and forget the war.  
Loud axes thro’ the groaning groves resound;  
Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;  
First fall from high; and some the trunks receive  
In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.  

And now the fatal news by Fame is blown  
Thro’ the short circuit of th’ Arcadian town,  
Of Pallas slain—by Fame, which just before  
His triumphs on distended pinions bore.  
Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,  
Each with a fun’ral flambeau in his hand.  
Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:  
The fields are lighten’d with a fiery blaze,  
That cast a sullen splendour on their friends, </pre></div> </div>
