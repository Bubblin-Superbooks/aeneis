And in Evander’s palace sought repose.  
Now, falling by another’s wound, his eyes  
He cast to heav’n, on Argos thinks, and dies.  

The pious Trojan then his jav’lin sent;  
The shield gave way; thro’ treble plates it went  
Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll’d,  
And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.  
All these it pass’d, resistless in the course,  
Transpierc’d his thigh, and spent its dying force.  
The gaping wound gush’d out a crimson flood.  
The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,  
His falchion drew, to closer fight address’d,  
And with new force his fainting foe oppress’d.  

His father’s peril Lausus view’d with grief;  
He sigh’d, he wept, he ran to his relief. </pre></div> </div>
