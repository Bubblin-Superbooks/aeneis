I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)  
Th’ Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho’ born  
On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,  
And Samothracia, Samos call’d before.  
From Tuscan Coritum he claim’d his birth;  
But after, when exempt from mortal earth,  
From thence ascended to his kindred skies,  
A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice.”  

He said. Ilioneus made this reply:  
“O king, of Faunus’ royal family!  
Nor wintry winds to Latium forc’d our way,  
Nor did the stars our wand’ring course betray.  
Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,  
The port, so long desir’d, at length we found;  
From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell’d;  
Great as the greatest that the sun beheld. </pre></div> </div>
