In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,  
And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.  
The spear flew hissing thro’ the middle space,  
And pierc’d his throat, directed at his face;  
It stopp’d at once the passage of his wind,  
And the free soul to flitting air resign’d:  
His forehead was the first that struck the ground;  
Lifeblood and life rush’d mingled thro’ the wound.  
He slew three brothers of the Borean race,  
And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,  
Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace.  
Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:  
The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,  
Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,  
These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.  
With mutual blood th’ Ausonian soil is dyed, </pre></div> </div>
