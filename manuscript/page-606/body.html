(A dart were lost within that roomy breast),  
But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,  
Which roar’d like thunder as it whirl’d along:  
Not two bull hides th’ impetuous force withhold,  
Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold.  
Down sunk the monster bulk and press’d the ground;  
His arms and clatt’ring shield on the vast body sound,  
Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,  
Rais’d on the seas, the surges to control—  
At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;  
Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall  
Of the vast pile; the scatter’d ocean flies;  
Black sands, discolour’d froth, and mingled mud arise:  
The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;  
Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:  
Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove’s command,  
Astonish’d at the flaw that shakes the land, </pre></div> </div>
