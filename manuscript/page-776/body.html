Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.  
Charg’d with my message, to Camilla go,  
And say I sent thee to the shades below,  
An honour undeserv’d from Cynthia’s bow.”  

She said, and from her quiver chose with speed  
The winged shaft, predestin’d for the deed;  
Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,  
Till the far distant horns approach’d on either side.  
The bowstring touch’d her breast, so strong she drew;  
Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.  
At once the twanging bow and sounding dart  
The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart.  
Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,  
His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.  
The conqu’ring damsel, with expanded wings,  
The welcome message to her mistress brings. </pre></div> </div>
