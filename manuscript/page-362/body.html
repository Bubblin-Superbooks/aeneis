Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,  
And pale Diseases, and repining Age,  
Want, Fear, and Famine’s unresisted rage;  
Here Toils, and Death, and Death’s half-brother, Sleep,  
Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;  
With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,  
Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;  
The Furies’ iron beds; and Strife, that shakes  
Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.  
Full in the midst of this infernal road,  
An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:  
The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,  
And empty dreams on ev’ry leaf are spread.  
Of various forms unnumber’d spectres more,  
Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door.  
Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands, </pre></div> </div>
