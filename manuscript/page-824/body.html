And now both armies shock in open field;  
Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill’d.  
Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain  
(All fam’d in arms, and of the Latian train)  
By Gyas’, Mnestheus’, and Achates’ hand.  
The fatal augur falls, by whose command  
The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued  
With Trojan blood, th’ unhappy fight renew’d.  
Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky,  
And o’er the field the frighted Latins fly.  
The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,  
Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;  
Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,  
He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.  
Juturna heard, and, seiz’d with mortal fear,  
Forc’d from the beam her brother’s charioteer;  
Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien, </pre></div> </div>
