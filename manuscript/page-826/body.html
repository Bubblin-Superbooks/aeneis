And far away the Daunian hero bears.  

What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail;  
And various cares in vain his mind assail.  
The great Messapus, thund’ring thro’ the field,  
In his left hand two pointed jav’lins held:  
Encount’ring on the prince, one dart he drew,  
And with unerring aim and utmost vigour threw.  
Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low  
Beneath his buckler, shunn’d the threat’ning blow.  
The weapon hiss’d above his head, and tore  
The waving plume which on his helm he wore.  
Forced by this hostile act, and fir’d with spite,  
That flying Turnus still declin’d the fight,  
The Prince, whose piety had long repell’d  
His inborn ardour, now invades the field;  
Invokes the pow’rs of violated peace, </pre></div> </div>
