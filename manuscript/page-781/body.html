He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death.</p><pre class="  "><code>When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,  
Their armies broken, and their courage quell’d,  
Himself become the mark of public spite,  
His honour question’d for the promis’d fight;  
The more he was with vulgar hate oppress’d,  
The more his fury boil’d within his breast:  
He rous’d his vigour for the last debate,  
And rais’d his haughty soul to meet his fate. </pre></div> </div>
