It reach’d his heart, nor needs a second thrust.  
Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;  
First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:  
Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail’d  
Diores, and in equal fight prevail’d.  
Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;  
Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.  

Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,  
Whom without respite at one charge he slew:  
Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress’d,  
And sad Onythes, added to the rest,  
Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.  

Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,  
And from Apollo’s fane to battle sent,  
O’erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. </pre></div> </div>
