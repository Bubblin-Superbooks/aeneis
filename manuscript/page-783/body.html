Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,  
And to my single virtue trust the war.  
The Latians unconcern’d shall see the fight;  
This arm unaided shall assert your right:  
Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,  
To him the crown and beauteous bride remain.”  

To whom the king sedately thus replied:  
“Brave youth, the more your valour has been tried,  
The more becomes it us, with due respect,  
To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.  
You want not wealth, or a successive throne,  
Or cities which your arms have made your own:  
My towns and treasures are at your command,  
And stor’d with blooming beauties is my land;  
Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,  
Unmarried, fair, of noble families. </pre></div> </div>
