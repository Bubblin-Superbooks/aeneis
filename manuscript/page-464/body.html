Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.  

In midst of Italy, well known to fame,  
There lies a lake, Amsanctus is the name,  
Below the lofty mounts: on either side  
Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.  
Full in the centre of the sacred wood  
An arm arises of the Stygian flood,  
Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,  
Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.  
Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,  
And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.  
To this infernal lake the Fury flies;  
Here hides her hated head, and frees the labâ€™ring skies.  

Saturnian Juno now, with double care,  
Attends the fatal process of the war. </pre></div> </div>
