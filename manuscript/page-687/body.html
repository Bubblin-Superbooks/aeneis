And here, heroic youth, ’tis here I must  
To thy immortal memory be just,  
And sing an act so noble and so new,  
Posterity will scarce believe ’tis true.  
Pain’d with his wound, and useless for the fight,  
The father sought to save himself by flight:  
Encumber’d, slow he dragg’d the spear along,  
Which pierc’d his thigh, and in his buckler hung.  
The pious youth, resolv’d on death, below  
The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;  
Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.  
Shouts of applause ran ringing thro’ the field,  
To see the son the vanquish’d father shield.  
All, fir’d with gen’rous indignation, strive,  
And with a storm of darts to distance drive  
The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,  
On his Vulcanian orb sustain’d the war. </pre></div> </div>
