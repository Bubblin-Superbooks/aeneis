He claims the bull with awless insolence,  
And having seiz’d his horns, accosts the prince:  
“If none my matchless valour dares oppose,  
How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?  
Permit me, chief, permit without delay,  
To lead this uncontended gift away.”  
The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries  
For the proud challenger demands the prize.  

Acestes, fir’d with just disdain, to see  
The palm usurp’d without a victory,  
Reproach’d Entellus thus, who sate beside,  
And heard and saw, unmov’d, the Trojan’s pride:  
“Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,  
So tamely can you bear the ravish’d crown,  
A prize in triumph borne before your sight,  
And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? </pre></div> </div>
