One drop of all our fathers’, in our veins,  
That man would I prefer before the rest,  
Who dar’d his death with an undaunted breast;  
Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound,  
To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw’d the ground.  
But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,  
If our confederates can afford us more;  
If the contended field we bravely fought,  
And not a bloodless victory was bought;  
Their losses equal’d ours; and, for their slain,  
With equal fires they fill’d the shining plain;  
Why thus, unforc’d, should we so tamely yield,  
And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?  
Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,  
Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:  
Some, rais’d aloft, come tumbling down amain;  
Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. </pre></div> </div>
