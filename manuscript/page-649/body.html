His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,  
Us’d threat’nings mix’d with pray’rs, his last resource,  
With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force  
“Which way, companions? whether would you run?  
By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,  
By my great sire, by his establish’d name,  
And early promise of my future fame;  
By my youth, emulous of equal right  
To share his honours—shun ignoble flight!  
Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way  
Thro’ yon black body, and that thick array:  
’Tis thro’ that forward path that we must come;  
There lies our way, and that our passage home.  
Nor pow’rs above, nor destinies below  
Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go,  
With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe. </pre></div> </div>
