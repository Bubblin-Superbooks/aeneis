This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?  
Is it for you to ravage seas and land,  
Unauthoriz’d by my supreme command?  
To raise such mountains on the troubled main?  
Whom I—but first ’tis fit the billows to restrain;  
And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.  
Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear,  
The realms of ocean and the fields of air  
Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me  
The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.  
His pow’r to hollow caverns is confin’d:  
There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,  
With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,  
And boast and bluster in his empty hall.”  
He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth’d the sea,  
Dispell’d the darkness, and restor’d the day.  
Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train </pre></div> </div>
