Bear back the breathless body on a shield.  
O grace and grief of war! at once restor’d,  
With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor’d!  
One day first sent thee to the fighting field,  
Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill’d;  
One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.  
This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,  
But sad spectators, to the hero came:  
His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,  
Unless reliev’d by his victorious hand.  
He whirls his sword around, without delay,  
And hews thro’ adverse foes an ample way,  
To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:  
Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow’d  
To large deserts, are present to his eyes;  
His plighted hand, and hospitable ties. </pre></div> </div>
