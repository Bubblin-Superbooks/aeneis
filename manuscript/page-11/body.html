Expos’d to wants, and hurried into wars!  
Can heav’nly minds such high resentment show,  
Or exercise their spite in human woe?  

Against the Tiber’s mouth, but far away,  
An ancient town was seated on the sea;  
A Tyrian colony; the people made  
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:  
Carthage the name; belov’d by Juno more  
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.  
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav’n were kind,  
The seat of awful empire she design’d.  
Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly,  
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)  
That times to come should see the Trojan race  
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow’rs deface;  
Nor thus confin’d, the yoke of sov’reign sway </pre></div> </div>
