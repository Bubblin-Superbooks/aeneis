A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew.  
Yet in the face of danger some there stood:  
The two bold brothers of Sarpedon’s blood,  
Asius and Acmon; both th’ Assaraci;  
Young Haemon, and tho’ young, resolv’d to die.  
With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join’d;  
Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind.  
From Acmon’s hands a rolling stone there came,  
So large, it half deserv’d a mountain’s name:  
Strong-sinew’d was the youth, and big of bone;  
His brother Mnestheus could not more have done,  
Or the great father of th’ intrepid son.  
Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;  
And some with darts, and some with stones defend.  

Amid the press appears the beauteous boy,  
The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. </pre></div> </div>
