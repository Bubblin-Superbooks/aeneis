With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.  
Sev’n bullocks, yet unyok’d, for Phoebus choose,  
And for Diana sev’n unspotted ewes.”  
This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,  
While to the temple she the prince invites.  
A spacious cave, within its farmost part,  
Was hew’d and fashion’d by laborious art  
Thro’ the hill’s hollow sides: before the place,  
A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;  
As many voices issue, and the sound  
Of Sybil’s words as many times rebound.  
Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:  
“This is the time; enquire your destinies.  
He comes; behold the god!” Thus while she said,  
(And shiv’ring at the sacred entry stay’d,)  
Her colour chang’d; her face was not the same,  
And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. </pre></div> </div>
