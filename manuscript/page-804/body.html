Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain’d,  
Which have so long their lazy sons sustain’d.”

With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir’d:

And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.

With lying wonders, and a false presage;  
But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,  
Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.

And o’er their heads his sounding pinions shakes; </pre></div> </div>
