Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;  
But first collected in his arms he stood:  
Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,  
Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.  
Around his head he toss’d his glitt’ring brand,  
And from Strymonius hew’d his better hand,  
Held up to guard his throat; then hurl’d a stone  
At Thoas’ ample front, and pierc’d the bone:  
It struck beneath the space of either eye;  
And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.  
Deep skill’d in future fates, Halesus’ sire  
Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:  
But, when the father’s mortal race was run,  
Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,  
And haul’d him to the war, to find, beneath  
Th’ Evandrian spear, a memorable death. </pre></div> </div>
