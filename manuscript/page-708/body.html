The pikes and lances trail along the ground.  
Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse  
To Pallantean tow’rs direct their course,  
In long procession rank’d, the pious chief  
Stopp’d in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:  
“The public care,” he said, “which war attends,  
Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.  
Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!  
Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!”  
He said no more, but, inly thro’ he mourn’d,  
Restrained his tears, and to the camp return’d.  

Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand  
A truce, with olive branches in their hand;  
Obtest his clemency, and from the plain  
Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.  
They plead, that none those common rites deny </pre></div> </div>
