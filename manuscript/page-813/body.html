The God of Battles, in his angry mood,  
Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,  
Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:  
Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;  
Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.  
Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair  
(Dire faces, and deform’d) surround the car;  
Friends of the god, and followers of the war.  
With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,  
Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:  
His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,  
He lashes on, and urges o’er the dead.  
Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,  
The gore and gath’ring dust are dash’d around.  
Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,  
He kill’d at hand, but Sthenelus afar:  
From far the sons of Imbracus he slew, </pre></div> </div>
