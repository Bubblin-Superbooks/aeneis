With cheerful words reliev’d his lab’ring mind:  
“O goddess-born, resign’d in ev’ry state,  
With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.  
By suff’ring well, our Fortune we subdue;  
Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.  
Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;  
To him disclose the secrets of your mind:  
Trust in his hands your old and useless train;  
Too num’rous for the ships which yet remain:  
The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,  
The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,  
With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand  
The shock of battle with your foes by land.  
Here you may build a common town for all,  
And, from Acestes’ name, Acesta call.”  
The reasons, with his friend’s experience join’d,  
Encourag’d much, but more disturb’d his mind. </pre></div> </div>
