Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays  
The champions’ fate, and each exactly weighs.  
On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;  
Loaded with death, that other scale descends.  
Rais’d on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow  
Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:  
Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side,  
As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.  
But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,  
And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.  
Now is but death, or flight; disarm’d he flies,  
When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.  
Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join’d,  
Hurrying to war, disorder’d in his mind,  
Snatch’d the first weapon which his haste could find.  
’Twas not the fated sword his father bore, </pre></div> </div>
