(As once I was) were mistress of your will,  
From your almighty pow’r your pleasing wife  
Might gain the grace of length’ning Turnus’ life,  
Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,  
And give him to his aged father’s sight.  
Now let him perish, since you hold it good,  
And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.  
Yet from our lineage he derives his name,  
And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;  
Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,  
And offers daily incense at your shrine.”  

Then shortly thus the sov’reign god replied:  
“Since in my pow’r and goodness you confide,  
If for a little space, a lengthen’d span,  
You beg reprieve for this expiring man,  
I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence </pre></div> </div>
