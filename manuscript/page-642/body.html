Then these elects, the landing to prevent;  
And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.  

Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:  
Some are by boats expos’d, by bridges more.  
With lab’ring oars they bear along the strand,  
Where the tide languishes, and leap a-land.  
Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,  
And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,  
Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,  
But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,  
That course he steer’d, and thus he gave command:  
“Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:  
Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound  
This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.  
Let me securely land—I ask no more;  
Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore.” </pre></div> </div>
