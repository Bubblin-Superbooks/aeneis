Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,  
And, casting off his slough when spring returns,  
Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;  
Restor’d with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides  
Reflect the sun; and rais’d on spires he rides;  
High o’er the grass, hissing he rolls along,  
And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.  
Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,  
His father’s charioteer, together run  
To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry  
Rush on in crowds, and the barr’d passage free.  
Ent’ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;  
And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.  
Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,  
And with his ax repeated strokes bestows  
On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,  
Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. </pre></div> </div>
