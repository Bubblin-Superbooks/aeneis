Accepts the presents vow’d for victory,  
And hangs the monumental crowns on high.  
Vast crowds of vanquish’d nations march along,  
Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.  
Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place  
For Carians, and th’ ungirt Numidian race;  
Then ranks the Thracians in the second row,  
With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow.  
And here the tam’d Euphrates humbly glides,  
And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides,  
And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind;  
The Danes’ unconquer’d offspring march behind,  
And Morini, the last of humankind.  

These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,  
By Vulcan labour’d, and by Venus brought,  
With joy and wonder fill the hero’s thought. </pre></div> </div>
