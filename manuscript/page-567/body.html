Each in his longing arms by turns he took;  
Panted and paus’d; and thus again he spoke:  
“Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,  
In recompense of such desert, decree?  
The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,  
The gods and your own conscious worth will give.  
The rest our grateful gen’ral will bestow,  
And young Ascanius till his manhood owe.”  

“And I, whose welfare in my father lies,”  
Ascanius adds, “by the great deities,  
By my dear country, by my household gods,  
By hoary Vesta’s rites and dark abodes,  
Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;  
That and my faith I plight into your hands,)  
Make me but happy in his safe return,  
Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; </pre></div> </div>
