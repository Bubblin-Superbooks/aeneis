Then whirl’d aloft his sword with all his might:  
Th’ unerring steel descended while he spoke,  
Pierc’d his wide mouth, and thro’ his weazon broke.  
Dying, he slew; and, stagg’ring on the plain,  
With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;  
Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,  
Content, in death, to be reveng’d so well.  

O happy friends! for, if my verse can give  
Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,  
Fix’d as the Capitol’s foundation lies,  
And spread, where’er the Roman eagle flies!  

The conqu’ring party first divide the prey,  
Then their slain leader to the camp convey.  
With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill’d,  
To see such numbers whom so few had kill’d. </pre></div> </div>
