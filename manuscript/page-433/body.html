In this high temple, on a chair of state,  
The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;  
Then gave admission to the Trojan train;  
And thus with pleasing accents he began:  
“Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,  
Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown;  
Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:  
Were you by stress of weather cast aground?  
Such dangers as on seas are often seen,  
And oft befall to miserable men,  
Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,  
Spent and disabled in so long a way?  
Say what you want: the Latians you shall find  
Not forc’d to goodness, but by will inclin’d;  
For, since the time of Saturn’s holy reign,  
His hospitable customs we retain. </pre></div> </div>
