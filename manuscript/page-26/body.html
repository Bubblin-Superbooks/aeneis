Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.  
Aeneas climbs the mountain’s airy brow,  
And takes a prospect of the seas below,  
If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,  
Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.

He took the quiver and the trusty bow  
Achates us’d to bear: the leaders first

Sev’n mighty bodies with their blood distain.  
For the sev’n ships he made an equal share,  
And to the port return’d, triumphant from the war. </pre></div> </div>
