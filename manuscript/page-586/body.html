Thus looks the prop my declining years!  
Was’t on this face my famish’d eyes I fed?  
Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!  
And could’st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?  
Not one kind kiss from a departing son!  
No look, no last adieu before he went,  
In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!  
Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,  
To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!  
Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,  
To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,  
To call about his corpse his crying friends,  
Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)  
On his dear body, which I wove with care,  
Nor did my daily pains or nightly labour spare.  
Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains  
His trunk dismember’d, and his cold remains? </pre></div> </div>
