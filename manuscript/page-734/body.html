Pity your own, or pity our estate;  
Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.  
Your interest is, the war should never cease;  
But we have felt enough to wish the peace:  
A land exhausted to the last remains,  
Depopulated towns, and driven plains.  
Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow’r,  
A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow’r,  
So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,  
And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.  
Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;  
We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:  
A base ignoble crowd, without a name,  
Unwept, unworthy, of the fun’ral flame,  
By duty bound to forfeit each his life,  
That Turnus may possess a royal wife.  
Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew </pre></div> </div>
