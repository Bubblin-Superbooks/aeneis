And justly punish whom I justly hate!  
But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,  
If I, to save myself, your empire save.  
The Grecian hopes, and all th’ attempts they made,  
Were only founded on Minerva’s aid.  
But from the time when impious Diomede,  
And false Ulysses, that inventive head,  
Her fatal image from the temple drew,  
The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,  
Her virgin statue with their bloody hands  
Polluted, and profan’d her holy bands;  
From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,  
And ebb’d much faster than it flow’d before:  
Their courage languish’d, as their hopes decay’d;  
And Pallas, now averse, refus’d her aid.  
Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare  
Her alter’d mind and alienated care. </pre></div> </div>
