Resolv’d, and willing, under my command,  
To run all hazards both of sea and land.  
The Morn began, from Ida, to display  
Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:  
Before the gates the Grecians took their post,  
And all pretence of late relief was lost.  
I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,  
And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.”  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
