Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear’d,  
And thus their drooping courages he cheer’d:  
“My friends, and Hector’s followers heretofore,  
Exert your vigour; tug the lab’ring oar;  
Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer’d crew,  
Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.  
In this, our common int’rest, let me find  
That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,  
As when you stemm’d the strong Malean flood,  
And o’er the Syrtes’ broken billows row’d.  
I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;  
Tho’ yet——But, ah! that haughty wish is vain!  
Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.  
But to be last, the lags of all the race!  
Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.”  
Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row  
At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow. </pre></div> </div>
