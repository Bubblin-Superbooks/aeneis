And lifting up to heav’n his hands and eyes,  
Ador’d the greater gods: ‘Avert,’ said he,  
‘These omens; render vain this prophecy,  
And from th’ impending curse a pious people free!’  

“Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;  
We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,  
And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat’ry way.  
Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;  
And next by rocky Neritos we steer:  
We fly from Ithaca’s detested shore,  
And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.  
At length Leucate’s cloudy top appears,  
And the Sun’s temple, which the sailor fears.  
Resolv’d to breathe a while from labour past,  
Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,  
And joyful to the little city haste. </pre></div> </div>
