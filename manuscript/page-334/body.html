And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.  
The tempests fly before their father’s face,  
Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,  
And monster whales before their master play,  
And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat’ry way.  
The marshal’d pow’rs in equal troops divide  
To right and left; the gods his better side  
Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.  

Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,  
Within the hero’s mind his joys renew’d.  
He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;  
The cheerful crew with diligence obey;  
They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.  
Ahead of all the master pilot steers;  
And, as he leads, the following navy veers. </pre></div> </div>
