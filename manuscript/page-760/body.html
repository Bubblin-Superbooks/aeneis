They clash with manly force their moony shields;  
With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.  

Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,  
On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?  
Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,  
With fury driv’n, from side to side transpierc’d:  
A purple stream came spouting from the wound;  
Bath’d in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.  
Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:  
The former, as the slacken’d reins he drew  
Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch’d  
His arm to prop his friend, the jav’lin reach’d.  
By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,  
Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.  
Amastrus next is added to the slain:  
The rest in rout she follows o’er the plain: </pre></div> </div>
