The wrongful sentence, and award a new.  
Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;  
And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.  
Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,  
Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.  
The next, in place and punishment, are they  
Who prodigally throw their souls away;  
Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,  
And loathing anxious life, suborn’d their fate.  
With late repentance now they would retrieve  
The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;  
Their pains and poverty desire to bear,  
To view the light of heav’n, and breathe the vital air:  
But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,  
And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.  

Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear </pre></div> </div>
