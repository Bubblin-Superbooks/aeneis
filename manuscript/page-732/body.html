Fear set apart, tho’ death is in my way)  
The plains of Latium run with blood around.  
So many valiant heroes bite the ground;  
Dejected grief in ev’ry face appears;  
A town in mourning, and a land in tears;  
While he, th’ undoubted author of our harms,  
The man who menaces the gods with arms,  
Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,  
And sought his safety in ignoble flight.  
Now, best of kings, since you propose to send  
Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;  
Add yet a greater at our joint request,  
One which he values more than all the rest:  
Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;  
With that alliance let the league be tied,  
And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.  
Let insolence no longer awe the throne; </pre></div> </div>
