Free leave is giv’n him, when his fatal hand  
Has cover’d with more corps the sanguine strand,  
And high as mine his tow’ring trophies stand.  
If any doubt remains, who dares the most,  
Let us decide it at the Trojan’s cost,  
And issue both abreast, where honour calls—  
(Foes are not far to seek without the walls)  
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,  
And feet were giv’n him but to speed his flight.  
I beaten from the field? I forc’d away?  
Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?  
Had he but ev’n beheld the fight, his eyes  
Had witness’d for me what his tongue denies:  
What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,  
And how the bloody Tiber swell’d the main.  
All saw, but he, th’ Arcadian troops retire  
In scatter’d squadrons, and their prince expire. </pre></div> </div>
