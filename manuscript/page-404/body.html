High as the Mother of the Gods in place,  
And proud, like her, of an immortal race.  
Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round,  
With golden turrets on her temples crown’d;  
A hundred gods her sweeping train supply;  
Her offspring all, and all command the sky.  

“Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see  
Your Roman race, and Julian progeny.  
The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour,  
Impatient for the world, and grasps his promis’d pow’r.  
But next behold the youth of form divine,  
Caesar himself, exalted in his line;  
Augustus, promis’d oft, and long foretold,  
Sent to the realm that Saturn rul’d of old;  
Born to restore a better age of gold. </pre></div> </div>
