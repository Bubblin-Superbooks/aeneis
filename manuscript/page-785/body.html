Twice vanquish’d while in bloody fields we strive,  
Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:  
The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;  
The bones of Latians blanch the neighb’ring shore.  
Why put I not an end to this debate,  
Still unresolv’d, and still a slave to fate?  
If Turnus’ death a lasting peace can give,  
Why should I not procure it whilst you live?  
Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,  
What would my kinsmen, the Rutulians, say?  
And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav’n defend!)  
How curse the cause which hasten’d to his end  
The daughter’s lover and the father’s friend?  
Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;  
Pity your parent’s age, and ease his care.”  

Such balmy words he pour’d, but all in vain: </pre></div> </div>
