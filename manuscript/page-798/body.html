Aeneas then unsheath’d his shining sword,  
And thus with pious pray’rs the gods ador’d:  
“All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,  
For which I have sustain’d so long a toil,  
Thou, King of Heav’n, and thou, the Queen of Air,  
Propitious now, and reconcil’d by pray’r;  
Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway  
The labours and events of arms obey;  
Ye living fountains, and ye running floods,  
All pow’rs of ocean, all ethereal gods,  
Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,  
Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,  
My Trojans shall encrease Evander’s town;  
Ascanius shall renounce th’ Ausonian crown:  
All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;  
Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace. </pre></div> </div>
