Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside  
Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried  
The foulness of th’ infernal form to hide.

Her face is furrow’d, and her front obscene;  
Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;  
Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;  
Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,  
Her temples with an olive wreath are crown’d.

Of Juno, now she seem’d, and thus began,  
Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:  
“Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain  
In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?  
Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,  
Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?  
The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, </pre></div> </div>
