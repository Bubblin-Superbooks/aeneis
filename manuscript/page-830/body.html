Not with less rage the rival heroes take  
Their diff’rent ways, nor less destruction make.  
With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike;  
And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.  
Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;  
And hearts are pierc’d, unknowing how to yield:  
They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;  
And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.  

Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs  
From a long royal race of Latian kings,  
Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,  
Crush’d with the weight of an unwieldy stone:  
Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore  
His living load, his dying body tore.  
His starting steeds, to shun the glitt’ring sword,  
Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. </pre></div> </div>
