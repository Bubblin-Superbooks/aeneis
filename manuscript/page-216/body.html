The brawny guards in martial order stand.  
A flow’r’d simar with golden fringe she wore,  
And at her back a golden quiver bore;  
Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,  
A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.  
Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,  
Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.  
But far above the rest in beauty shines  
The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;  
Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost  
Of wint’ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,  
When to his native Delos he resorts,  
Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;  
Where painted Scythians, mix’d with Cretan bands,  
Before the joyful altars join their hands:  
Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below  
The merry madness of the sacred show. </pre></div> </div>
