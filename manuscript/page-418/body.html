Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.  
Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe’s pow’r,  
(That watch’d the moon and planetary hour,)  
With words and wicked herbs from humankind  
Had alter’d, and in brutal shapes confin’d.  
Which monsters lest the Trojans’ pious host  
Should bear, or touch upon th’ inchanted coast,  
Propitious Neptune steer’d their course by night  
With rising gales that sped their happy flight.  
Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,  
And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.  
Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,  
And wav’d her saffron streamer thro’ the skies;  
When Thetis blush’d in purple not her own,  
And from her face the breathing winds were blown,  
A sudden silence sate upon the sea,  
And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way. </pre></div> </div>
