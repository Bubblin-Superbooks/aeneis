August in visage, and serenely bright.  
His mother goddess, with her hands divine,  
Had form’d his curling locks, and made his temples shine,  
And giv’n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,  
And breath’d a youthful vigour on his face;  
Like polish’d ivory, beauteous to behold,  
Or Parian marble, when enchas’d in gold:  
Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,  
And thus with manly modesty he spoke:  

“He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss’d,  
And sav’d from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;  
Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,  
A prince that owes his life to you alone.  
Fair majesty, the refuge and redress  
Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress, </pre></div> </div>
