And Vulcan rides at large with loosen’d reins:  
Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,  
And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars.  
Eumelus was the first the news to bear,  
While yet they crowd the rural theatre.  
Then, what they hear, is witness’d by their eyes:  
A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.  
Ascanius took th’ alarm, while yet he led  
His early warriors on his prancing steed,  
And, spurring on, his equals soon o’erpass’d;  
Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.  
Soon as the royal youth appear’d in view,  
He sent his voice before him as he flew:  
“What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy  
The last remainders of unhappy Troy!  
Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,  
And on your friends your fatal fury turn. </pre></div> </div>
