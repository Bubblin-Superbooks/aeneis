And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.  
Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,  
When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,  
And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.  
At length she finds the dear perfidious man;  
Prevents his form’d excuse, and thus began:  
“Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,  
And undiscover’d scape a lover’s eye?  
Nor could my kindness your compassion move.  
Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?

Not worth preventing, tho’ too well foreseen?  
Ev’n when the wintry winds command your stay,  
You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.  
False as you are, suppose you were not bound  
To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;  
Were Troy restor’d, and Priam’s happy reign, </pre></div> </div>
