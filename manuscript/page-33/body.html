He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,  
Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,  
And, with hard labour, Alba Longa build.  
The throne with his succession shall be fill’d  
Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen  
Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,  
Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,  
Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.  
The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:  
Then Romulus his grandsire’s throne shall gain,  
Of martial tow’rs the founder shall become,  
The people Romans call, the city Rome.  
To them no bounds of empire I assign,  
Nor term of years to their immortal line.  
Ev’n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,  
Earth, seas, and heav’n, and Jove himself turmoils;  
At length aton’d, her friendly pow’r shall join, </pre></div> </div>
