The grove itself resembles Ida’s wood;  
And Simois seem’d the well-dissembled flood.  
But when at nearer distance she beheld  
My shining armour and my Trojan shield,  
Astonish’d at the sight, the vital heat  
Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:  
She faints, she falls, and scarce recov’ring strength,  
Thus, with a falt’ring tongue, she speaks at length:  

“‘Are you alive, O goddess-born?’ she said,  
‘Or if a ghost, then where is Hector’s shade?’  
At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.  
With broken words I made this brief reply:  
‘All of me that remains appears in sight;  
I live, if living be to loathe the light.  
No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,  
My fate resembling that of Hector’s wife. </pre></div> </div>
