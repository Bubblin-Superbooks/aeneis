Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.  

Astonish’d Aunus just arrives by chance,  
To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;

And then on equal terms begin the fight:  
It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,  
When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,”

Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,  
And leaves her horse at large among her train; </pre></div> </div>
