Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn;  
And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne,  
Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms;  
And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur’d arms.”  

He said, and, rising from his homely throne,  
The solemn rites of Hercules begun,  
And on his altars wak’d the sleeping fires;  
Then cheerful to his household gods retires;  
There offers chosen sheep. Th’ Arcadian king  
And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.  
Next, of his men and ships he makes review;  
Draws out the best and ablest of the crew.  
Down with the falling stream the refuse run,  
To raise with joyful news his drooping son.  
Steeds are prepar’d to mount the Trojan band,  
Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land. </pre></div> </div>
