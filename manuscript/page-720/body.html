All in that universal sorrow share,  
And curse the cause of this unhappy war:  
A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,  
A crown usurp’d, which with their blood is bought!  
These are the crimes with which they load the name  
Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:  
“Let him who lords it o’er th’ Ausonian land  
Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:  
His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;  
’Tis just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.”  
This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:  
“His foe expects, and dares him to the fight.”  
Nor Turnus wants a party, to support  
His cause and credit in the Latian court.  
His former acts secure his present fame,  
And the queen shades him with her mighty name. </pre></div> </div>
