Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,  
And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;  
All clad in shining arms the works invest,  
Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.  
Stretch’d at their length, they press the grassy ground;  
They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)  
With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,  
And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.  

The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,  
And with arm’d legions all the rampires fill’d.  
Seiz’d with affright, their gates they first explore;  
Join works to works with bridges, tow’r to tow’r:  
Thus all things needful for defence abound.  
Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,  
Commission’d by their absent prince to share  
The common danger, and divide the care. </pre></div> </div>
