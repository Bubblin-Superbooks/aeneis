The Trojans, coop’d within their walls so long,  
Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,  
Like swarming bees, and with delight survey  
The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:  
The quarters of the sev’ral chiefs they show’d;  
Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;  
Here join’d the battles; there the navy rode.  
Part on the pile their wond’ring eyes employ:  
The pile by Pallas rais’d to ruin Troy.  
Thymoetes first (’tis doubtful whether hir’d,  
Or so the Trojan destiny requir’d)  
Mov’d that the ramparts might be broken down,  
To lodge the monster fabric in the town.  
But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,  
The fatal present to the flames designed,  
Or to the wat’ry deep; at least to bore  
The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. </pre></div> </div>
