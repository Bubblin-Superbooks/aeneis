With pow’r imperial curbs the struggling winds,  
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.  
This way and that th’ impatient captives tend,  
And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.  
High in his hall th’ undaunted monarch stands,  
And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;  
Which did he not, their unresisted sway  
Would sweep the world before them in their way;  
Earth, air, and seas thro’ empty space would roll,  
And heav’n would fly before the driving soul.  
In fear of this, the Father of the Gods  
Confin’d their fury to those dark abodes,  
And lock’d ’em safe within, oppress’d with mountain loads;  
Impos’d a king, with arbitrary sway,  
To loose their fetters, or their force allay.  
To whom the suppliant queen her pray’rs address’d, </pre></div> </div>
