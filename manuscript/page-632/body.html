Borne in the Tiger thro’ the foaming sea;  
From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care:  
For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear.  
Fierce Abas next: his men bright armour wore;  
His stern Apollo’s golden statue bore.  
Six hundred Populonia sent along,  
All skill’d in martial exercise, and strong.  
Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins,  
An isle renown’d for steel, and unexhausted mines.  
Asylas on his prow the third appears,  
Who heav’n interprets, and the wand’ring stars;  
From offer’d entrails prodigies expounds,  
And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds.  
A thousand spears in warlike order stand,  
Sent by the Pisans under his command.  

Fair Astur follows in the wat’ry field, </pre></div> </div>
