The burthen of his feeble father bore!  
I should have torn him piecemeal; strow’d in floods  
His scatter’d limbs, or left expos’d in woods;  
Destroy’d his friends and son; and, from the fire,  
Have set the reeking boy before the sire.  
Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:  
Yet where’s the doubt, to souls secure of fate?  
My Tyrians, at their injur’d queen’s command,  
Had toss’d their fires amid the Trojan band;  
At once extinguish’d all the faithless name;  
And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,  
Had fall’n upon the pile, to mend the fun’ral flame.  
Thou Sun, who view’st at once the world below;  
Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;  
Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!  
Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,  
All pow’rs invok’d with Dido’s dying breath, </pre></div> </div>
