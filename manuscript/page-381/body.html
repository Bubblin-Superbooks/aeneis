For, when the fatal horse, descending down,  
Pregnant with arms, o’erwhelm’d th’ unhappy town  
She feign’d nocturnal orgies; left my bed,  
And, mix’d with Trojan dames, the dances led  
Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,  
Which rous’d the Grecians from their ambuscade.  
With watching overworn, with cares oppress’d,  
Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,  
And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess’d.  
Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,  
And from beneath my head my sword convey’d;  
The door unlatch’d, and, with repeated calls,  
Invites her former lord within my walls.  
Thus in her crime her confidence she plac’d,  
And with new treasons would redeem the past.  
What need I more? Into the room they ran,  
And meanly murder’d a defenceless man. </pre></div> </div>
