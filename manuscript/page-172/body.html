She spoke; and mix’d her speech with mournful cries,  
And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.  

“At length her lord descends upon the plain,  
In pomp, attended with a num’rous train;  
Receives his friends, and to the city leads,  
And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.  
Proceeding on, another Troy I see,  
Or, in less compass, Troy’s epitome.  
A riv’let by the name of Xanthus ran,  
And I embrace the Scaean gate again.  
My friends in porticoes were entertain’d,  
And feasts and pleasures thro’ the city reign’d.  
The tables fill’d the spacious hall around,  
And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown’d.  
Two days we pass’d in mirth, till friendly gales,  
Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails. </pre></div> </div>
