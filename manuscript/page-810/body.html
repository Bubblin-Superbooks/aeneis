The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.  
Following the blow, he seiz’d his curling crown  
With his left hand; his other cast him down.  
The prostrate body with his knees he press’d,  
And plung’d his holy poniard in his breast.  

While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued  
The shepherd Alsus thro’ the flying crowd,  
Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow  
Full on the front of his unwary foe.  
The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,  
And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;  
Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around  
An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress’d,  
And seal’d their heavy lids in endless rest. </pre></div> </div>
