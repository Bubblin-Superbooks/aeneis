T’ inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?  
Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends,  
Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends.  
That new example wanted yet above:  
An act that well became the wife of Jove!  
Alecto, rais’d by her, with rage inflames  
The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames.  
Imperial sway no more exalts my mind;  
(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav’n was kind;)  
Now let my happier foes possess my place,  
Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race;  
And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.  
Since you can spare, from all your wide command,  
No spot of earth, no hospitable land,  
Which may my wand’ring fugitives receive;  
(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)  
Then, father, (if I still may use that name,) </pre></div> </div>
