Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:  
A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast.  
As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,  
So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;  
Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,  
And ev’ry mouth is furnish’d with a tongue,  
And round with list’ning ears the flying plague is hung.  
She fills the peaceful universe with cries;  
No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;  
By day, from lofty tow’rs her head she shews,  
And spreads thro’ trembling crowds disastrous news;  
With court informers haunts, and royal spies;  
Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies.  

Talk is her business, and her chief delight </pre></div> </div>
