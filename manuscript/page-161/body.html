And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.  
Cast from our course, we wander in the dark.  
No stars to guide, no point of land to mark.  
Ev’n Palinurus no distinction found  
Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign’d around.  
Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays,  
Without distinction, and three sunless days;  
The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,  
We view a rising land, like distant clouds;  
The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,  
And curling smoke ascending from their height.  
The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;  
From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly.  
At length I land upon the Strophades,  
Safe from the danger of the stormy seas.  
Those isles are compass’d by th’ Ionian main, </pre></div> </div>
