The marching troop which their dead prince attends.  
Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;  
The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,  
And their mix’d mourning rends the vaulted sky.  
The town is fill’d with tumult and with tears,  
Till the loud clamours reach Evander’s ears:  
Forgetful of his state, he runs along,  
With a disorder’d pace, and cleaves the throng;  
Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,  
With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.  
Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks  
A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:  

“O Pallas! thou hast fail’d thy plighted word,  
To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!  
I warn’d thee, but in vain; for well I knew  
What perils youthful ardour would pursue, </pre></div> </div>
