Thus while he spoke, already she began,  
With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;  
From head to foot survey’d his person o’er,  
Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:  
“False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!  
Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,  
But hewn from harden’d entrails of a rock!  
And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!  
Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?  
Did he once look, or lent a list’ning ear,  
Sigh’d when I sobb’d, or shed one kindly tear?  
All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,  
So foul, that, which is worse, ’tis hard to find.  
Of man’s injustice why should I complain?  
The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain  
Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies, </pre></div> </div>
