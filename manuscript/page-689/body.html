For now the Fates prepar’d their sharpen’d shears;  
And lifted high the flaming sword appears,  
Which, full descending with a frightful sway,  
Thro’ shield and corslet forc’d th’ impetuous way,  
And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.  
The purple streams thro’ the thin armour strove,  
And drench’d th’ imbroider’d coat his mother wove;  
And life at length forsook his heaving heart,  
Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.  

But when, with blood and paleness all o’erspread,  
The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,  
He griev’d; he wept; the sight an image brought  
Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:  
Then stretch’d his hand to hold him up, and said:  
“Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid  
To love so great, to such transcendent store </pre></div> </div>
