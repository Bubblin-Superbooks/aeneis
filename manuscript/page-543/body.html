The god had figur’d her as driv’n along  
By winds and waves, and scudding thro’ the throng.  
Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide  
His arms and ample bosom to the tide,  
And spreads his mantle o’er the winding coast,  
In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host.

With spoils and altars ev’ry temple grac’d.  
Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,  
The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,  
The domes with songs, the theatres with plays.  
All altars flame: before each altar lies,  
Drench’d in his gore, the destin’d sacrifice.  
Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,  
Before Apollo’s porch of Parian stone; </pre></div> </div>
