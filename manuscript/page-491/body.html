My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.”  

He said, and plung’d below. While yet he spoke,  
His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.  
He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies  
With purple blushing, and the day arise.  
Then water in his hollow palm he took  
From Tiber’s flood, and thus the pow’rs bespoke:  
“Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,  
And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed  
Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.  
Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,  
Conceals thy wat’ry stores; where’er they rise,  
And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;  
Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn  
Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,  
For this thy kind compassion of our woes, </pre></div> </div>
