Then thus th’ almighty sire began: “Ye gods,  
Natives or denizens of blest abodes,  
From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind,  
This backward fate from what was first design’d?  
Why this protracted war, when my commands  
Pronounc’d a peace, and gave the Latian lands?  
What fear or hope on either part divides  
Our heav’ns, and arms our powers on diff’rent sides?  
A lawful time of war at length will come,  
(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),  
When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,  
Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,  
And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.  
Then is your time for faction and debate,  
For partial favour, and permitted hate. </pre></div> </div>
