When first her fatal image touch’d the ground,  
She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,  
That sparkled as they roll’d, and seem’d to threat:  
Her heav’nly limbs distill’d a briny sweat.  
Thrice from the ground she leap’d, was seen to wield  
Her brandish’d lance, and shake her horrid shield.  
Then Calchas bade our host for flight  
And hope no conquest from the tedious war,  
Till first they sail’d for Greece; with pray’rs besought  
Her injur’d pow’r, and better omens brought.  
And now their navy plows the wat’ry main,  
Yet soon expect it on your shores again,  
With Pallas pleas’d; as Calchas did ordain.  
But first, to reconcile the blue-ey’d maid  
For her stol’n statue and her tow’r betray’d,  
Warn’d by the seer, to her offended name  
We rais’d and dedicate this wondrous frame, </pre></div> </div>
