Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear  
His crested snakes, and arm’d his bristling hair.  
The prudent Sibyl had before prepar’d  
A sop, in honey steep’d, to charm the guard;  
Which, mix’d with pow’rful drugs, she cast before  
His greedy grinning jaws, just op’d to roar.  
With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,  
With hunger press’d, devours the pleasing bait.  
Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;  
He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.  
The keeper charm’d, the chief without delay  
Pass’d on, and took th’ irremeable way.  
Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,  
Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,  
Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws  
Condemn’d to die, when traitors judg’d their cause.  
Nor want they lots, nor judges to review </pre></div> </div>
