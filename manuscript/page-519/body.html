Not less concern’d, nor at a later hour,  
Rose from his downy couch the forging pow’r.  

Sacred to Vulcan’s name, an isle there lay,  
Betwixt Sicilia’s coasts and Lipare,  
Rais’d high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,  
In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.

Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,  
Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,  
And smoky flames thro’ fuming tunnels soar.  
Hither the Father of the Fire, by night,  
Thro’ the brown air precipitates his flight.  
On their eternal anvils here he found  
The brethren beating, and the blows go round.  
A load of pointless thunder now there lies  
Before their hands, to ripen for the skies: </pre></div> </div>
