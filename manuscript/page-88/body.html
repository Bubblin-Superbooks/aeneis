The dismal day was come; the priests prepare  
Their leaven’d cakes, and fillets for my hair.  
I follow’d nature’s laws, and must avow  
I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.  
Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,  
Secure of safety when they sail’d away.  
But now what further hopes for me remain,  
To see my friends, or native soil, again;  
My tender infants, or my careful sire,  
Whom they returning will to death require;  
Will perpetrate on them their first design,  
And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?  
Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,  
If there be faith below, or gods above,  
If innocence and truth can claim desert,  
Ye Trojans, from an injur’d wretch avert.’ </pre></div> </div>
