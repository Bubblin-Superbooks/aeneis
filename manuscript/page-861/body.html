What can thy sister more to save thy life?  
Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend  
In arms with that inexorable fiend?  
Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright  
My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;  
The lashing of your wings I know too well,  
The sounding flight, and fun’ral screams of hell!  
These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,  
The worthy recompense of ravish’d love!  
Did he for this exempt my life from fate?  
O hard conditions of immortal state,  
Tho’ born to death, not privileg’d to die,  
But forc’d to bear impos’d eternity!  
Take back your envious bribes, and let me go  
Companion to my brother’s ghost below!  
The joys are vanish’d: nothing now remains,  
Of life immortal, but immortal pains. </pre></div> </div>
