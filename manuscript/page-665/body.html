Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:  
With his protended lance he makes defence;  
Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,  
Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;  
Stands o’er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,  
Vain tales inventing, and prepar’d to pray,  
Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,  
Then sunk, and roll’d along the sand in blood.  
The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:  
“Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;  
Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,  
Far from thy mother and thy native home,  
Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,  
Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea.”  

On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,  
Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van. </pre></div> </div>
