Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about  
The flames; and foes for entrance press without,  
With thousand others, whom I fear to name,  
More than from Argos or Mycenae came.  
To sev’ral posts their parties they divide;  
Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:  
The bold they kill, th’ unwary they surprise;  
Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.  
The warders of the gate but scarce maintain  
Th’ unequal combat, and resist in vain.’  

“I heard; and Heav’n, that well-born souls inspires,  
Prompts me thro’ lifted swords and rising fires  
To run where clashing arms and clamour calls,  
And rush undaunted to defend the walls.  
Ripheus and Iph’itas by my side engage,  
For valour one renown’d, and one for age. </pre></div> </div>
