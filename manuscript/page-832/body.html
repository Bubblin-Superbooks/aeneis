But who can pass the bounds, prefix’d by fate?  
In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held  
Two palaces, and was from each expell’d:  
Of all the mighty man, the last remains  
A little spot of foreign earth contains.  

And now both hosts their broken troops unite  
In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight.  
Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join  
The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line:  
Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads  
The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads.  
They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,  
Resolv’d on death, impatient of disgrace;  
And, where one falls, another fills his place.  

The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son </pre></div> </div>
