Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,  
To rush from high on his unequal foe.  

Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance  
Within due distance of his flying lance,  
Prepares to charge him first, resolv’d to try  
If fortune would his want of force supply;  
And thus to Heav’n and Hercules address’d:  
“Alcides, once on earth Evander’s guest,  
His son adjures you by those holy rites,  
That hospitable board, those genial nights;  
Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,  
And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,  
His ravish’d spoils.” ’Twas heard, the vain request;  
Alcides mourn’d, and stifled sighs within his breast.  
Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:  
“Short bounds of life are set to mortal man. </pre></div> </div>
