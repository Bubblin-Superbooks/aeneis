A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;  
And, thro’ his vast dominions, priests ordain’d,  
Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain’d.  
The gates and columns were with garlands crown’d,  
And blood of victim beasts enrich’d the ground.  

He, when he heard a fugitive could move  
The Tyrian princess, who disdain’d his love,  
His breast with fury burn’d, his eyes with fire,  
Mad with despair, impatient with desire;  
Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,  
He thus with pray’rs implor’d his sire divine:  
“Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,  
Who feast on painted beds, with off’rings grace  
Thy temples, and adore thy pow’r divine  
With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,  
Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain </pre></div> </div>
