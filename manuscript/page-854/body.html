To stop the Fates now lab’ring in th’ event?  
What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?  
Divine Aeneas, (and thou know’st it too,)  
Foredoom’d, to these celestial seats are due.  
What more attempts for Turnus can be made,  
That thus thou ling’rest in this lonely shade?  
Is it becoming of the due respect  
And awful honour of a god elect,  
A wound unworthy of our state to feel,  
Patient of human hands and earthly steel?  
Or seems it just, the sister should restore  
A second sword, when one was lost before,  
And arm a conquer’d wretch against his conqueror?  
For what, without thy knowledge and avow,  
Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?  
At last, in deference to my love, forbear  
To lodge within thy soul this anxious care; </pre></div> </div>
