When heav’n’s propitious pow’rs refuse their aid!  
Behold the royal prophetess, the fair  
Cassandra, dragg’d by her dishevel’d hair,  
Whom not Minerva’s shrine, nor sacred bands,  
In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:  
On heav’n she cast her eyes, she sigh’d, she cried,  
(’Twas all she could) her tender arms were tied.  
So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;  
But, fir’d with rage, distracted with despair,  
Amid the barb’rous ravishers he flew:  
Our leader’s rash example we pursue.  
But storms of stones, from the proud temple’s height,  
Pour down, and on our batter’d helms alight:  
We from our friends receiv’d this fatal blow,  
Who thought us Grecians, as we seem’d in show.  
They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;  
And ours beneath the pond’rous ruin lie. </pre></div> </div>
