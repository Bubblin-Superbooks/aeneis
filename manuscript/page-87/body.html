And Grecian blood once more atone the main.”  
The spreading rumour round the people ran;  
All fear’d, and each believ’d himself the man.  
Ulysses took th’ advantage of their fright;  
Call’d Calchas, and produc’d in open sight:  
Then bade him name the wretch, ordain’d by fate  
The public victim, to redeem the state.  
Already some presag’d the dire event,  
And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.  
For twice five days the good old seer withstood  
Th’ intended treason, and was dumb to blood,  
Till, tir’d, with endless clamours and pursuit  
Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;  
But, as it was agreed, pronounc’d that I  
Was destin’d by the wrathful gods to die.  
All prais’d the sentence, pleas’d the storm should fall  
On one alone, whose fury threaten’d all. </pre></div> </div>
