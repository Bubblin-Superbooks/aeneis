His charioteer, intrench’d betwixt the wheels  
And his lov’d horses; last invades their lord;  
Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:  
The gasping head flies off; a purple flood  
Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,  
Which, by the spurning heels dispers’d around,  
The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.  
Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,  
He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.  
From dice and wine the youth retir’d to rest,  
And puff’d the fumy god from out his breast:  
Ev’n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play—  
More lucky, had it lasted till the day.  
The famish’d lion thus, with hunger bold,  
O’erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,  
And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe  
Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw. </pre></div> </div>
