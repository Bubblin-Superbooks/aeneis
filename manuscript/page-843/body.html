The mists of passion, and resum’d her sway.  
Then, rising on his car, he turn’d his look,  
And saw the town involv’d in fire and smoke.  
A wooden tow’r with flames already blaz’d,  
Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais’d;  
And bridges laid above to join the space,  
And wheels below to roll from place to place.  
“Sister, the Fates have vanquish’d: let us go  
The way which Heav’n and my hard fortune show.  
The fight is fix’d; nor shall the branded name  
Of a base coward blot your brother’s fame.  
Death is my choice; but suffer me to try  
My force, and vent my rage before I die.”  
He said; and, leaping down without delay,  
Thro’ crowds of scatter’d foes he freed his way.  
Striding he pass’d, impetuous as the wind,  
And left the grieving goddess far behind. </pre></div> </div>
