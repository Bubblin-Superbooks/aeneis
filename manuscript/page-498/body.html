Then answer’d briefly, with a royal grace:  
“O valiant leader of the Trojan line,  
In whom the features of thy father shine,  
How I recall Anchises! how I see  
His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!  
Long tho’ it be, ’tis fresh within my mind,  
When Priam to his sister’s court design’d  
A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,  
And thro’ th’ Arcadian kingdom took his way.  
Then, past a boy, the callow down began  
To shade my chin, and call me first a man.  
I saw the shining train with vast delight,  
And Priam’s goodly person pleas’d my sight:  
But great Anchises, far above the rest,  
With awful wonder fir’d my youthful breast.  
I long’d to join in friendship’s holy bands  
Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands. </pre></div> </div>
