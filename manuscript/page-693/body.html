And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight  
Of hated men, and of more hated light:  
But will not long.” With that he rais’d from ground  
His fainting limbs, that stagger’d with his wound;  
Yet, with a mind resolv’d, and unappall’d  
With pains or perils, for his courser call’d  
Well-mouth’d, well-manag’d, whom himself did dress  
With daily care, and mounted with success;  
His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.  

Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,  
The steed seem’d sensible, while thus he spoke:  
“O Rhoebus, we have liv’d too long for me—  
If life and long were terms that could agree!  
This day thou either shalt bring back the head  
And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;  
This day thou either shalt revenge my woe, </pre></div> </div>
