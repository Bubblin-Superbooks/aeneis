Their dying lady, drooping on the plain.  
Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies,  
With beating heart, and fear confus’d with joys;  
Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,  
Or ev’n to bear the sight of his expiring foe.  
As, when the wolf has torn a bullock’s hide  
At unawares, or ranch’d a shepherd’s side,  
Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,  
And claps his quiv’ring tail between his thighs:  
So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,  
But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.  

She wrench’d the jav’lin with her dying hands,  
But wedg’d within her breast the weapon stands;  
The wood she draws, the steely point remains;  
She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:  
(A gath’ring mist o’erclouds her cheerful eyes, </pre></div> </div>
