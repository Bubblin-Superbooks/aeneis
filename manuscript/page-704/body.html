While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare  
To send him back his portion of the war,  
A bloody breathless body, which can owe  
No farther debt, but to the pow’rs below.  
The wretched father, ere his race is run,  
Shall view the fun’ral honours of his son.  
These are my triumphs of the Latian war,  
Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!  
And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see  
A son whose death disgrac’d his ancestry;  
Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev’d:  
Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv’d.  
He died no death to make thee wish, too late,  
Thou hadst not liv’d to see his shameful fate:  
But what a champion has th’ Ausonian coast,  
And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!” </pre></div> </div>
