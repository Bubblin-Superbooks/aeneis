Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,  
By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.  
Thrice he the sword assay’d, and thrice the flood;  
But Juno, mov’d with pity, both withstood.  
And thrice repress’d his rage; strong gales supplied,  
And push’d the vessel o’er the swelling tide.  
At length she lands him on his native shores,  
And to his father’s longing arms restores.  

Meantime, by Jove’s impulse, Mezentius arm’d,  
Succeeding Turnus, with his ardour warm’d  
His fainting friends, reproach’d their shameful flight,  
Repell’d the victors, and renew’d the fight.  
Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;  
Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire  
Of wish’d revenge: on him, and him alone, </pre></div> </div>
