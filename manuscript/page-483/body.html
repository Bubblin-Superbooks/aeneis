Roll’d from a silver urn his crystal flood.  
A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields  
With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt’ring shields;  
Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands,  
And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands;  
Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields,  
And the proud Labicans, with painted shields,  
And those who near Numician streams reside,  
And those whom Tiber’s holy forests hide,  
Or Circe’s hills from the main land divide;  
Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,  
Or the black water of Pomptina stands.  

Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came,  
And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;  
Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill’d,  
She chose the nobler Pallas of the field. </pre></div> </div>
