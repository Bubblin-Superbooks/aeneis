Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro’ the skies.  
These clamours with disdain the Scylla heard,  
Much grudg’d the praise, but more the robb’d reward:  
Resolv’d to hold their own, they mend their pace,  
All obstinate to die, or gain the race.  
Rais’d with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;  
For they can conquer, who believe they can.  
Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,  
And both perhaps had shar’d an equal prize;  
When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,  
And succour from the wat’ry pow’rs demands:  
“Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!  
If, giv’n by you, the laurel bind my brow,  
Assist to make me guilty of my vow!  
A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;  
His offer’d entrails cast into the main, </pre></div> </div>
