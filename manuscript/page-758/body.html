His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.  
Catillus pierc’d Iolas first; then drew  
His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,  
The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.  
His neck and throat unarm’d, his head was bare,  
But shaded with a length of yellow hair:  
Secure, he fought, expos’d on ev’ry part,  
A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.  
Across the shoulders came the feather’d wound;  
Transfix’d he fell, and doubled to the ground.  
The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,  
And death with honour sought on either side.  

Resistless thro’ the war Camilla rode,  
In danger unappall’d, and pleas’d with blood.  
One side was bare for her exerted breast;  
One shoulder with her painted quiver press’d. </pre></div> </div>
