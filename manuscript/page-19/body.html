Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields  
Of heroes, whose dismember’d hands yet bear  
The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!”  

Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,  
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,  
And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,  
And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:  
Nor can the shiv’ring oars sustain the blow;  
The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;  
While those astern, descending down the steep,  
Thro’ gaping waves behold the boiling deep.  
Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,  
And on the secret shelves with fury cast.  
Those hidden rocks th’ Ausonian sailors knew:  
They call’d them Altars, when they rose in view,  
And show’d their spacious backs above the flood. </pre></div> </div>
