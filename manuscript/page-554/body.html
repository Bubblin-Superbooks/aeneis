And Phlegethon’s innavigable flood,  
And the black regions of his brother god.  
He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.  

And now at length the number’d hours were come,  
Prefix’d by fate’s irrevocable doom,  
When the great Mother of the Gods was free  
To save her ships, and finish Jove’s decree.  
First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung  
A light that sign’d the heav’ns, and shot along;  
Then from a cloud, fring’d round with golden fires,  
Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;  
And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,  
Both hosts, in arms oppos’d, with equal horror wounds:  
“O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,  
And know, my ships are my peculiar care. </pre></div> </div>
