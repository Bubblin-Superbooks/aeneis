Press’d in his arms the pond’rous prey sustains;  
Then, with his shorten’d spear, explores around  
His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.  
Nor less the captive struggles for his life:  
He writhes his body to prolong the strife,  
And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts  
His utmost vigour, and the point averts.  
So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,  
And bears a speckled serpent thro’ the sky,  
Fast’ning his crooked talons on the prey:  
The pris’ner hisses thro’ the liquid way;  
Resists the royal hawk; and, tho’ oppress’d,  
She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:  
Turn’d to her foe, she stiffens ev’ry scale,  
And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat’ning tail.  
Against the victor, all defence is weak: </pre></div> </div>
