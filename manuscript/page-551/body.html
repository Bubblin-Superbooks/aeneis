The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs  
Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.  
Thus ranges eager Turnus o’er the plain.  
Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;  
Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,  
To force his foes in equal field to fight.  
Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,  
Where, fenc’d with strong redoubts, their navy lies,  
Close underneath the walls; the washing tide  
Secures from all approach this weaker side.  
He takes the wish’d occasion, fills his hand  
With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.  
Urg’d by his presence, ev’ry soul is warm’d,  
And ev’ry hand with kindled fires is arm’d.  
From the fir’d pines the scatt’ring sparkles fly;  
Fat vapours, mix’d with flames, involve the sky.  
What pow’r, O Muses, could avert the flame </pre></div> </div>
