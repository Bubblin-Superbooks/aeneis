This day revives within my mind what she  
Foretold of Troy renew’d in Italy,  
And Latian lands; but who could then have thought  
That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought,  
Or who believ’d what mad Cassandra taught?  
Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.’  

“He said; and we with glad consent obey,  
Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,  
We spread our sails before the willing wind.  
Now from the sight of land our galleys move,  
With only seas around and skies above;  
When o’er our heads descends a burst of rain,  
And night with sable clouds involves the main;  
The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;  
The scatter’d fleet is forc’d to sev’ral ways;  
The face of heav’n is ravish’d from our eyes, </pre></div> </div>
