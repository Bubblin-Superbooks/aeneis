Continue still your hospitable way,  
And still invent occasions of their stay,  
Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat,  
And planks and oars repair their shatter’d fleet.”  

These words, which from a friend and sister came,  
With ease resolv’d the scruples of her fame,  
And added fury to the kindled flame.  
Inspir’d with hope, the project they pursue;  
On ev’ry altar sacrifice renew:  
A chosen ewe of two years old they pay  
To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day;  
Preferring Juno’s pow’r, for Juno ties  
The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys.  
The beauteous queen before her altar stands,  
And holds the golden goblet in her hands.  
A milk-white heifer she with flow’rs adorns, </pre></div> </div>
