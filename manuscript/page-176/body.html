For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find.  
Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,  
Which fronts from far th’ Epirian continent:  
Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess’d;  
The salvage Locrians here the shores infest;  
There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,  
And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;  
And on the mountain’s brow Petilia stands,  
Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.  
Ev’n when thy fleet is landed on the shore,  
And priests with holy vows the gods adore,  
Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,  
Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice.  
These rites and customs to the rest commend,  
That to your pious race they may descend.
