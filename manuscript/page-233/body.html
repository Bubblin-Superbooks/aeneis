What have I left? or whither can I fly?  
Must I attend Pygmalion’s cruelty,  
Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead

And left behind some pledge of our delight,  
Some babe to bless the mother’s mournful sight,  
Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,  
Whose features might express his father’s face;  
I should not then complain to live bereft  
Of all my husband, or be wholly left.”

Your boundless favours, or I own my debt; </pre></div> </div>
