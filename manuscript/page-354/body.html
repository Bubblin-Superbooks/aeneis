And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown’d;  
Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:  
The gazing crowd around the body stand.  
All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,  
And hastens to perform the funeral state.  
In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;  
The basis broad below, and top advanc’d in air.  
An ancient wood, fit for the work design’d,  
(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)  
The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;  
Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow’ring pride  
Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,  
And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.  
Huge trunks of trees, fell’d from the steepy crown  
Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.  
Arm’d like the rest the Trojan prince appears,  
And by his pious labour urges theirs. </pre></div> </div>
