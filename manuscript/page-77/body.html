When from his lofty couch he thus began:  
“Great queen, what you command me to relate  
Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:  
An empire from its old foundations rent,  
And ev’ry woe the Trojans underwent;  
A peopled city made a desert place;  
All that I saw, and part of which I was:  
Not ev’n the hardest of our foes could hear,  
Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear.  
And now the latter watch of wasting night,  
And setting stars, to kindly rest invite;  
But, since you take such int’rest in our woe,  
And Troy’s disastrous end desire to know,  
I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell  
What in our last and fatal night befell. </pre></div> </div>
