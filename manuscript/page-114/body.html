And heavy beams and rafters from the sides  
(Such arms their last necessity provides)  
And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,  
The marks of state and ancient royalty.  
The guards below, fix’d in the pass, attend  
The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.  
Renew’d in courage with recover’d breath,  
A second time we ran to tempt our death,  
To clear the palace from the foe, succeed  
The weary living, and revenge the dead.  

“A postern door, yet unobserv’d and free,  
Join’d by the length of a blind gallery,  
To the king’s closet led: a way well known  
To Hector’s wife, while Priam held the throne,  
Thro’ which she brought Astyanax, unseen,  
To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire’s queen. </pre></div> </div>
