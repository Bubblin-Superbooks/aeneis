Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,  
And, shiver’d by the force, come piecemeal down.  
Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,  
Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.  
Enceladus, they say, transfix’d by Jove,  
With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;  
And, where he fell, th’ avenging father drew  
This flaming hill, and on his body threw.  
As often as he turns his weary sides,  
He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.  
In shady woods we pass the tedious night,  
Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,  
Of which no cause is offer’d to the sight;  
For not one star was kindled in the sky,  
Nor could the moon her borrow’d light supply;  
For misty clouds involv’d the firmament,  
The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. </pre></div> </div>
