The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,  
Whose grandsire was th’ unhappy king of Troy;  
His race in after times was known to fame,  
New honours adding to the Latian name;  
And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.  
White were the fetlocks of his feet before,  
And on his front a snowy star he bore.  
Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,  
Of equal age, the second squadron led.  
The last in order, but the first in place,  
First in the lovely features of his face,  
Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,  
Queen Dido’s gift, and of the Tyrian breed.  
Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,  
With golden bits adorn’d, and purple reins.  

The pleas’d spectators peals of shouts renew, </pre></div> </div>
