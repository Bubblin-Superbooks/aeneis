His lovely face unarm’d, his head was bare;  
In ringlets o’er his shoulders hung his hair.  
His forehead circled with a diadem;  
Distinguish’d from the crowd, he shines a gem,  
Enchas’d in gold, or polish’d iv’ry set,  
Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.  

Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war,  
Directing pointed arrows from afar,  
And death with poison arm’d—in Lydia born,  
Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn;  
Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands,  
And leaves a rich manure of golden sands.  
There Capys, author of the Capuan name,  
And there was Mnestheus too, increas’d in fame,  
Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. </pre></div> </div>
