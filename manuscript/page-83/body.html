I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;  
Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.  
Tho’ plung’d by Fortune’s pow’r in misery,  
’Tis not in Fortune’s pow’r to make me lie.  
If any chance has hither brought the name  
Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,  
Who suffer’d from the malice of the times,  
Accus’d and sentenc’d for pretended crimes,  
Because these fatal wars he would prevent;  
Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament;  
Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare  
Of other means, committed to his care,  
His kinsman and companion in the war.  
While Fortune favour’d, while his arms support  
The cause, and rul’d the counsels, of the court,  
I made some figure there; nor was my name  
Obscure, nor I without my share of fame. </pre></div> </div>
