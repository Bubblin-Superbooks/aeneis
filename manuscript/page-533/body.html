Gilded his arms, embroider’d was his vest.  
So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head  
The star by whom the lights of heav’n are led;  
Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,  
Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.

Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far  
The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.

O’er heathy plains pursue the ready way.  
Repeated peals of shouts are heard around;  
The neighing coursers answer to the sound,  
And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground.  

A greenwood shade, for long religion known,  
Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, </pre></div> </div>
