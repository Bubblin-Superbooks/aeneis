We come not with design of wasteful prey,  
To drive the country, force the swains away:  
Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;  
The vanquish’d dare not to such thoughts aspire.  
A land there is, Hesperia nam’d of old;  
The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold  
Th’ Oenotrians held it once, by common fame  
Now call’d Italia, from the leader’s name.  
To that sweet region was our voyage bent,  
When winds and ev’ry warring element  
Disturb’d our course, and, far from sight of land,  
Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:  
The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,  
Dispers’d and dash’d the rest upon the rocky shore.  
Those few you see escap’d the storm, and fear,  
Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.  
What men, what monsters, what inhuman race, </pre></div> </div>
