The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;  
And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.  
Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev’ry pore;  
With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o’er;  
Shorter and shorter ev’ry gasp he takes;  
And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.  
Plung’d in the flood, and made the waters fly.  
The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,  
And wip’d the sweat, and wash’d away the gore;  
Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,  
And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
