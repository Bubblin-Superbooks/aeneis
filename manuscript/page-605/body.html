Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,  
When suddenly th’ unhop’d-for news was brought,  
The foes had left the fastness of their place,  
Prevail’d in fight, and had his men in chase.  
He quits th’ attack, and, to prevent their fate,  
Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.  
The first he met, Antiphates the brave,  
But base-begotten on a Theban slave,  
Sarpedon’s son, he slew: the deadly dart  
Found passage thro’ his breast, and pierc’d his heart.  
Fix’d in the wound th’ Italian cornel stood,  
Warm’d in his lungs, and in his vital blood.  
Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,  
And Meropes, and the gigantic size  
Of Bitias, threat’ning with his ardent eyes.  
Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress’d </pre></div> </div>
