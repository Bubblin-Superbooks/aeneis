“Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire  
The fates of thine are fix’d, and stand entire.  
Thou shalt behold thy wish’d Lavinian walls;  
And, ripe for heav’n, when fate Aeneas calls,  
Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:  
No councils have revers’d my firm decree.  
And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,  
Know, I have search’d the mystic rolls of Fate:  
Thy son (nor is th’ appointed season far)  
In Italy shall wage successful war,  
Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,  
And sov’reign laws impose, and cities build,  
Till, after ev’ry foe subdued, the sun  
Thrice thro’ the signs his annual race shall run:  
This is his time prefix’d. Ascanius then,  
Now call’d Iulus, shall begin his reign. </pre></div> </div>
