Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.  
Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac’d,  
Where I my ruin in his arms embrac’d:  
All relics of the wretch are doom’d to fire;  
For so the priestess and her charms require.”  

Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;  
A mortal paleness in her face appears:  
Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find  
The secret fun’ral in these rites design’d;  
Nor thought so dire a rage possess’d her mind.  
Unknowing of a train conceal’d so well,  
She fear’d no worse than when Sichaeus fell;  
Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,  
Within the secret court, expos’d in air.  
The cloven holms and pines are heap’d on high,  
And garlands on the hollow spaces lie. </pre></div> </div>
