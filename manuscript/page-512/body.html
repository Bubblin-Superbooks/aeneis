Th’ Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;  
And Saturn’s empire often chang’d the name.  
Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,  
With arbitrary sway the land oppress’d:

By fortune’s pow’r, and fate’s resistless doom.  
Long toss’d on seas, I sought this happy land,  
Warn’d by my mother nymph, and call’d by Heav’n’s command.”  

Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew’d the gate,  
Since call’d Carmental by the Roman state;  
Where stood an altar, sacred to the name  
Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,  
Who to her son foretold th’ Aenean race, </pre></div> </div>
