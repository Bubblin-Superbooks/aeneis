The greater gods; their pardon then implores;  
Unbinds the fillet from his holy head;  
To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led,  
Full of religious doubts and awful dread.  
Then, with his god possess’d, before the shrine,  
These words proceeded from his mouth divine:  
‘O goddess-born, (for Heav’n’s appointed will,  
With greater auspices of good than ill,  
Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;  
Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)  
Of many things some few I shall explain,  
Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,  
And how at length the promis’d shore to gain.  
The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,  
And Juno’s angry pow’r forbids to tell.  
First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,  
Will far from your deluded wishes fly; </pre></div> </div>
