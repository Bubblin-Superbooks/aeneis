The living mark at which their arrows fly.  
The rival archers in a line advance,  
Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.  
A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:  
On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.  
The people shout. Upon the next was found  
Young Mnestheus, late with naval honours crown’d.  
The third contain’d Eurytion’s noble name,  
Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,  
Whom Pallas urg’d the treaty to confound,  
And send among the Greeks a feather’d wound.  
Acestes in the bottom last remain’d,  
Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain’d.  
Soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows,  
And from the quiver each his arrow chose.  
Hippocoon’s was the first: with forceful sway  
It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. </pre></div> </div>
