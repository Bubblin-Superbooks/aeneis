Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.  
Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,  
Glitt’ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,  
Was by the virgin view’d. The steed he press’d  
Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest  
With scales of gilded brass was cover’d o’er;  
A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.  
With deadly wounds he gall’d the distant foe;  
Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:  
A golden helm his front and head surrounds  
A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.  
Gold, weav’d with linen, on his thighs he wore,  
With flowers of needlework distinguish’d o’er,  
With golden buckles bound, and gather’d up before.  
Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,  
Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,  
Or that the temple might his trophies hold, </pre></div> </div>
