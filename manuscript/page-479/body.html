And o’er Campania stretch’d his ample sway,  
Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea;  
O’er Batulum, and where Abella sees,  
From her high tow’rs, the harvest of her trees.  
And these (as was the Teuton use of old)  
Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;  
Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight;  
Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.  

Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,  
And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.  
The rude Equicolae his rule obey’d;  
Hunting their sport, and plund’ring was their trade.  
In arms they plow’d, to battle still prepar’d:  
Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.
