And from her cheeks the rosy colour flies:)  
Then turns to her, whom of her female train  
She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:  
“Acca, ’tis past! he swims before my sight,  
Inexorable Death; and claims his right.  
Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed,  
And bid him timely to my charge succeed,  
Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:  
Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive.”  
She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:  
Dying, her open’d hand forsakes the rein;  
Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees  
Her mind the passage from her body frees.  
She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,  
Her drooping head declining on her breast:  
In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,  
And, murm’ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.</pre></div> </div>
