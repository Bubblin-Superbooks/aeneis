What earth will open her devouring womb,  
To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!”  
She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,  
But in her azure mantle wrapp’d her head,  
Then plung’d into her stream, with deep despair,  
And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.  

Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear  
Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:  
“What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?  
What empty hopes are harbour’d in his mind?  
’Tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;  
Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.  
Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare  
What skill and courage can attempt in war;  
Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;  
Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!” </pre></div> </div>
