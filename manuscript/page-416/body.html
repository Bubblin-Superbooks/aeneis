Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related.</p><pre class="  "><code>And thou, O matron of immortal fame,  
Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name;  
Cajeta still the place is call’d from thee,  
The nurse of great Aeneas’ infancy.  
Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia’s plains;  
Thy name (’tis all a ghost can have) remains. </pre></div> </div>
