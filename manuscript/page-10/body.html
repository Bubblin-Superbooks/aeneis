And haughty Juno’s unrelenting hate,  
Expell’d and exil’d, left the Trojan shore.  
Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore,  
And in the doubtful war, before he won  
The Latian realm, and built the destin’d town;  
His banish’d gods restor’d to rites divine,  
And settled sure succession in his line,  
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,  
And the long glories of majestic Rome.  
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;  
What goddess was provok’d, and whence her hate;  
For what offence the Queen of Heav’n began  
To persecute so brave, so just a man;  
Involv’d his anxious life in endless cares, </pre></div> </div>
