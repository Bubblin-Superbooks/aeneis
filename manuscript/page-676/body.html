What will they say of their deserting chief  
The war was mine: I fly from their relief;  
I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;  
And ev’n from hence their dying groans receive.  
Here, overmatch’d in fight, in heaps they lie;  
There, scatter’d o’er the fields, ignobly fly.  
Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!  
Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!  
On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;  
Or set me shipwreck’d on some desert shore,  
Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,  
Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,  
Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.”  

Thus Turnus rav’d, and various fates revolv’d:  
The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv’d.  
And now the sword, and now the sea took place, </pre></div> </div>
