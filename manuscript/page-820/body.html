A branch of healing dittany she brought,  
Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought:  
Rough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround;  
The leafs with flow’rs, the flow’rs with purple crown’d,  
Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief  
To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.  
This Venus brings, in clouds involv’d, and brews  
Th’ extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,  
And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,  
Temp’ring the mixture with her heav’nly hands,  
And pours it in a bowl, already crown’d  
With juice of med’c’nal herbs prepar’d to bathe the wound.  
The leech, unknowing of superior art  
Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;  
And in a moment ceas’d the raging smart. </pre></div> </div>
