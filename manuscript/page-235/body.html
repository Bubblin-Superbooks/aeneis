Why may not we, like you, a foreign race,  
Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?  
As often as the night obscures the skies  
With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,  
Anchises’ angry ghost in dreams appears,  
Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;  
And young Ascanius justly may complain  
Of his defrauded and destin’d reign.  
Ev’n now the herald of the gods appear’d:  
Waking I saw him, and his message heard.  
From Jove he came commission’d, heav’nly bright  
With radiant beams, and manifest to sight  
(The sender and the sent I both attest)  
These walls he enter’d, and those words express’d.  
Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;  
Forc’d by my fate, I leave your happy land.” </pre></div> </div>
