Till Heav’n afforded me this place of rest;  
Like you, an alien in a land unknown,

Then offer’d incense, and proclaim’d a feast.  
Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,  
Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;

With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;  
And jars of gen’rous wine and spacious bowls  
She gives, to cheer the sailors’ drooping souls.

And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:  
On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;  
With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,  
And antique vases, all of gold emboss’d  
(The gold itself inferior to the cost), </pre></div> </div>
