Who forc’d a passage with his pointed spear,  
Nor strong Alcides, men of mighty fame,  
And from th’ immortal gods their lineage came.  
In fetters one the barking porter tied,  
And took him trembling from his sov’reign’s side:  
Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.”  
To whom the Sibyl thus: “Compose thy mind;  
Nor frauds are here contriv’d, nor force design’d.  
Still may the dog the wand’ring troops constrain  
Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,  
And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.  
The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,  
Much fam’d for arms, and more for filial love,  
Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.  
If neither piety, nor Heav’n’s command,  
Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,  
This fatal present shall prevail at least.” </pre></div> </div>
