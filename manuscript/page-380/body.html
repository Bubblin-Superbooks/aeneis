Till tir’d, not forc’d, a glorious fate you chose,  
And fell upon a heap of slaughter’d foes.

A tomb and fun’ral honours I decreed;  
Thrice call’d your manes on the Trojan plains:  
The place your armour and your name retains.  
Your body too I sought, and, had I found,  
Design’d for burial in your native ground.”  

The ghost replied: “Your piety has paid  
All needful rites, to rest my wand’ring shade;  
But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,  
To Grecian swords betray’d my sleeping life.  
These are the monuments of Helen’s love:  
The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.  
You know in what deluding joys we pass’d  
The night that was by Heav’n decreed our last: </pre></div> </div>
