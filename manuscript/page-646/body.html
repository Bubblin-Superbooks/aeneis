Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain  
Against our foes, on this contended plain.”  
He said; then seiz’d a mighty spear, and threw;  
Which, wing’d with fate, thro’ Maeon’s buckler flew,  
Pierc’d all the brazen plates, and reach’d his heart:  
He stagger’d with intolerable smart.  
Alcanor saw; and reach’d, but reach’d in vain,  
His helping hand, his brother to sustain.  
A second spear, which kept the former course,  
From the same hand, and sent with equal force,  
His right arm pierc’d, and holding on, bereft  
His use of both, and pinion’d down his left.  
Then Numitor from his dead brother drew  
Th’ ill-omen’d spear, and at the Trojan threw:  
Preventing fate directs the lance awry,  
Which, glancing, only mark’d Achates’ thigh. </pre></div> </div>
