While, at the Lemnian god’s command, they urge  
Their labours thus, and ply th’ Aeolian forge,  
The cheerful morn salutes Evander’s eyes,  
And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.  
He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet  
Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:  
He sets his trusty sword upon his side,  
And o’er his shoulder throws a panther’s hide.  
Two menial dogs before their master press’d.  
Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.  
Mindful of promis’d aid, he mends his pace,  
But meets Aeneas in the middle space.  
Young Pallas did his father’s steps attend,  
And true Achates waited on his friend.  
They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;  
Th’ Arcadian first their former talk renews: </pre></div> </div>
