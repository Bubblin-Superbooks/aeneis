Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood  
A laurel’s trunk, a venerable wood;  
Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair  
Was kept and cut with superstitious care.  
This plant Latinus, when his town he wall’d,  
Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call’d;  
And last, in honour of his new abode,  
He vow’d the laurel to the laurel’s god.  
It happen’d once (a boding prodigy!)  
A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,  
Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,  
Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;  
There with their clasping feet together clung,  
And a long cluster from the laurel hung.  
An ancient augur prophesied from hence:  
“Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince! </pre></div> </div>
