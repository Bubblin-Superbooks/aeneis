Let gifts be to the mighty queen design’d,  
And mollify with pray’rs her haughty mind.  
Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free,  
And you shall safe descend on Italy.  
Arriv’d at Cumae, when you view the flood  
Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,  
The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,  
Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin’d.  
She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,  
The notes and names, inscrib’d, to leafs commits.  
What she commits to leafs, in order laid,  
Before the cavern’s entrance are display’d:  
Unmov’d they lie; but, if a blast of wind  
Without, or vapours issue from behind,  
The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air,  
And she resumes no more her museful care,  
Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter’d verse, </pre></div> </div>
