Controls the Thund’rer on his awful throne,  
To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,  
And on thy succour and thy faith relies.  
Thou know’st, my son, how Jove’s revengeful wife,  
By force and fraud, attempts thy brother’s life;  
And often hast thou mourn’d with me his pains.  
Him Dido now with blandishment detains;  
But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.  
For this ’tis needful to prevent her art,  
And fire with love the proud Phoenician’s heart:  
A love so violent, so strong, so sure,  
As neither age can change, nor art can cure.  
How this may be perform’d, now take my mind:  
Ascanius by his father is design’d  
To come, with presents laden, from the port,  
To gratify the queen, and gain the court.  
I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, </pre></div> </div>
