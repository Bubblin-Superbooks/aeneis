She fed within her veins a flame unseen;  
The hero’s valour, acts, and birth inspire  
Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.  
His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,  
Improve the passion, and increase the smart.

The dewy shadows, and restor’d the day,  
Her sister first with early care she sought,  
And thus in mournful accents eas’d her thought:  

“My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright  
My lab’ring soul! what visions of the night  
Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast  
With strange ideas of our Trojan guest!  
His worth, his actions, and majestic air,  
A man descended from the gods declare.  
Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; </pre></div> </div>
