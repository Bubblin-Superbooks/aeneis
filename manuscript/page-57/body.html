What laws, what barbâ€™rous customs of the place,  
Shut up a desert shore to drowning men,  
And drive us to the cruel seas again?  
If our hard fortune no compassion draws,  
Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,  
The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.  
Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,  
Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;  
Observant of the right, religious of his word.  
If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,  
Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;  
Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,  
Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.  
We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,  
Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.  
Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,  
Refitted from your woods with planks and oars, </pre></div> </div>
