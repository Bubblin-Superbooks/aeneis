Fix’d in the mast the feather’d weapon stands:  
The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,  
And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries  
Of the pleas’d people rend the vaulted skies.  
Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,  
With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,  
But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;  
Yet miss’d so narrow, that he cut the cord  
Which fasten’d by the foot the flitting bird.  
The captive thus releas’d, away she flies,  
And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.  
His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;  
And, having first invok’d his brother god,  
His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.  
The fatal message reach’d her as she fled:  
She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,  
And renders back the weapon in the wound. </pre></div> </div>
