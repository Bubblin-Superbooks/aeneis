Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,  
Dash’d on the shallows of the moving sand,  
And in mid ocean left them moor’d a-land.  
Orontes’ bark, that bore the Lycian crew,  
(A horrid sight!) ev’n in the hero’s view,  
From stem to stern by waves was overborne:  
The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,  
Was headlong hurl’d; thrice round the ship was toss’d,  
Then bulg’d at once, and in the deep was lost;  
And here and there above the waves were seen  
Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.  
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,  
And suck’d thro’ loosen’d planks the rushing sea.  
Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,  
Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,  
Endur’d not less; their ships, with gaping seams,  
Admit the deluge of the briny streams. </pre></div> </div>
