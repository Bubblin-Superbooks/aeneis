Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:  
It pierc’d thro’ all, and with a grisly wound  
Transfix’d his thigh, and doubled him to ground.  
With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:  
Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.  

Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,  
With eyes cast upward, and with arms display’d,  
And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray’d:  
“I know my death deserv’d, nor hope to live:  
Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.  
Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown,  
Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son.  
Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;  
And for Anchises’ sake old Daunus save!  
Or, if thy vow’d revenge pursue my death,  
Give to my friends my body void of breath! </pre></div> </div>
