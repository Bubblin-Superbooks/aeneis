The fight is mine; and me the gods require.  
’Tis just that I should vindicate alone  
The broken truce, or for the breach atone.  
This day shall free from wars th’ Ausonian state,  
Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.”  

Both armies from their bloody work desist,  
And, bearing backward, form a spacious list.  
The Trojan hero, who receiv’d from fame  
The welcome sound, and heard the champion’s name,  
Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,  
Greedy of war where greater glory calls.  
He springs to fight, exulting in his force  
His jointed armour rattles in the course.  
Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,  
Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,  
His head divine obscure in clouds he hides, </pre></div> </div>
