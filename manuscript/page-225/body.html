A martial race, and rule the Latian land,  
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,  
And on the conquer’d world impose the law.’

Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,  
Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,  
And grudge the Romans their immortal name!  
What are his vain designs! what hopes he more  
From his long ling’ring on a hostile shore,  
Regardless to redeem his honour lost,  
And for his race to gain th’ Ausonian coast!  
Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;  
With this command the slumb’ring warrior wake.”  

Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds  
His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:  
And, whether o’er the seas or earth he flies, </pre></div> </div>
