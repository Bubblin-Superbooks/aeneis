Saw Dido fetter’d in the chains of love,  
Hot with the venom which her veins inflam’d,  
And by no sense of shame to be reclaim’d,  
With soothing words to Venus she begun:  
“High praises, endless honours, you have won,  
And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!  
Two gods a silly woman have undone!  
Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect  
This rising city, which my hands erect:  
But shall celestial discord never cease?  
’Tis better ended in a lasting peace.  
You stand possess’d of all your soul desir’d:  
Poor Dido with consuming love is fir’d.  
Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join;  
So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine:  
One common kingdom, one united line.  
Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, </pre></div> </div>
