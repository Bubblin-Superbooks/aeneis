Th’ Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar,  
Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war:  
And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife,  
His ill fate follows him—th’ Egyptian wife.  
Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows  
The froth is gather’d, and the water glows.

Were rooted up, and justled in the main;  
Or floating mountains floating mountains meet;  
Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.  
Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav’lins fly;  
The fields of Neptune take a purple dye.  
The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms,  
With cymbals toss’d her fainting soldiers warms—  
Fool as she was! who had not yet divin’d  
Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind.  
Her country gods, the monsters of the sky, </pre></div> </div>
