A maple throne, rais’d higher from the ground,  
Receiv’d the Trojan chief; and, o’er the bed,  
A lion’s shaggy hide for ornament they spread.  
The loaves were serv’d in canisters; the wine  
In bowls; the priest renew’d the rites divine:  
Broil’d entrails are their food, and beef’s continued chine.  

But when the rage of hunger was repress’d,  
Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:  
“These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,  
From no vain fears or superstition spring,  
Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,  
Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;  
But, sav’d from danger, with a grateful sense,  
The labours of a god we recompense.  
See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky, </pre></div> </div>
