In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach.  
But Turnus follow’d hard his hunted prey  
(His spear had almost reach’d him in the way,  
Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)  
“Fool!” said the chief, “tho’ fleeter than the wind,  
Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?”  
He said, and downward by the feet he drew  
The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;  
Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls.  
Thus on some silver swan, or tim’rous hare,  
Jove’s bird comes sousing down from upper air;  
Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:  
Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.  
So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,  
In vain lamented by the bleating dam. </pre></div> </div>
