On Neptune’s faith the floating fleet relies;  
But what the man forsook, the god supplies,  
And o’er the dang’rous deep secure the navy flies;  
Glides by the Sirens’ cliffs, a shelfy coast,  
Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,  
And white with bones. Th’ impetuous ocean roars,  
And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.  
The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found  
The tossing vessel sail’d on shoaly ground.  
Sure of his pilot’s loss, he takes himself  
The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.  
Inly he griev’d, and, groaning from the breast,  
Deplor’d his death; and thus his pain express’d:  
“For faith repos’d on seas, and on the flatt’ring sky,  
Thy naked corpse is doom’d on shores unknown to lie.”  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
