A swelling cloud hung hov’ring o’er their head:  
Livid it look’d, the threat’ning of a storm:  
Then night and horror ocean’s face deform.  
The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud:  
“What gusts of weather from that gath’ring cloud  
My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,  
Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars;  
Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.”  
The frighted crew perform the task assign’d.  
Then, to his fearless chief: “Not Heav’n,” said he,  
“Tho’ Jove himself should promise Italy,  
Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.  
Mark how the shifting winds from west arise,  
And what collected night involves the skies!  
Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,  
Much less against the tempest force their way.  
’Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. </pre></div> </div>
