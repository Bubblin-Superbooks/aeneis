Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race,  
But first in order sent, to fill thy place;  
An Alban name, but mix’d with Dardan blood,  
Born in the covert of a shady wood:  
Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife,  
Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life.  
In Alba he shall fix his royal seat,  
And, born a king, a race of kings beget.  
Then Procas, honour of the Trojan name,  
Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame.  
A second Silvius after these appears;  
Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears;  
For arms and justice equally renown’d,  
Who, late restor’d, in Alba shall be crown’d.  
How great they look! how vig’rously they wield  
Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield!  
But they, who crown’d with oaken wreaths appear, </pre></div> </div>
