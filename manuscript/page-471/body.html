Their arms, and armies under their command;  
What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;  
What soldiers follow’d, and what heroes led.  
For well you know, and can record alone,  
What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.  
Mezentius first appear’d upon the plain:  
Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,  
Defying earth and heav’n. Etruria lost,  
He brings to Turnus’ aid his baffled host.  
The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,  
Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;  
To Turnus only second in the grace  
Of manly mien, and features of the face.  
A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,  
With fates averse a thousand men he led:  
His sire unworthy of so brave a son;  
Himself well worthy of a happier throne. </pre></div> </div>
