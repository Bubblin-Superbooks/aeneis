The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;  
Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:  
Against a yielded man, ’tis mean ignoble strife.”  

In deep suspense the Trojan seem’d to stand,  
And, just prepar’d to strike, repress’d his hand.  
He roll’d his eyes, and ev’ry moment felt  
His manly soul with more compassion melt;  
When, casting down a casual glance, he spied  
The golden belt that glitter’d on his side,  
The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore  
From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.  
Then, rous’d anew to wrath, he loudly cries  
(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)  
“Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,  
Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?  
To his sad soul a grateful off’ring go! </pre></div> </div>
