This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:  
They tug at ev’ry oar, and ev’ry stretcher bends;  
They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,  
(Thus forc’d ashore,) and tremble with the shock.  
Tarchon’s alone was lost, that stranded stood,  
Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:  
She breaks her back; the loosen’d sides give way,  
And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.  
Their broken oars and floating planks withstand  
Their passage, while they labour to the land,  
And ebbing tides bear back upon th’ uncertain sand.  

Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,  
Advancing to the margin of the sea.  
The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail’d  
The clowns new-rais’d and raw, and soon prevail’d. </pre></div> </div>
