Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,  
In search of seats remote from Italy,  
And from unwelcome inmates set us free.  
Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,  
Or twice as many more, if more they need.  
Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood  
Runs equal with the margin of the flood:  
Let them the number and the form assign;  
The care and cost of all the stores be mine.  
To treat the peace, a hundred senators  
Shall be commission’d hence with ample pow’rs,  
With olive the presents they shall bear,  
A purple robe, a royal iv’ry chair,  
And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,  
And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate  
This great affair, and save the sinking state.” </pre></div> </div>
