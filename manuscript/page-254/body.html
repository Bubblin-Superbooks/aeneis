And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;  
Fix’d on revenge, and obstinate to die.  
Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow’r to fly.  
The sea with ships will soon be cover’d o’er,  
And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.  
Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,  
And sail before the purple morn arise.  
Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?  
Woman’s a various and a changeful thing.”  
Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight  
Aloft in air unseen, and mix’d with night.  

Twice warn’d by the celestial messenger,  
The pious prince arose with hasty fear;  
Then rous’d his drowsy train without delay:  
“Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,  
And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea. </pre></div> </div>
