For this, alas! I left my needful ease,  
Expos’d my life to winds and winter seas!  
If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,  
Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;  
Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,  
And send me thunderstruck to shades below!”  
Her shrieks and clamours pierce the Trojans’ ears,  
Unman their courage, and augment their fears;  
Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,  
Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,  
But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,  
To bear the madding mother to her tent.  

And now the trumpets terribly, from far,  
With rattling clangour, rouse the sleepy war.  
The soldiers’ shouts succeed the brazen sounds;  
And heav’n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. </pre></div> </div>
