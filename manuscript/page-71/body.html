The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,  
Approach, and on the painted couches rest.  
All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,  
But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,  
His rosy-colour’d cheeks, his radiant eyes,  
His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god’s disguise;  
Nor pass unprais’d the vest and veil divine,  
Which wand’ring foliage and rich flow’rs entwine.  
But, far above the rest, the royal dame,  
(Already doom’d to love’s disastrous flame,)  
With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,  
Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.  
The guileful god about the hero long,  
With children’s play, and false embraces, hung;  
Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms  
With greedy pleasure, and devour’d his charms. </pre></div> </div>
