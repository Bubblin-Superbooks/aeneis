Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,  
Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:  
The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.  

Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,  
With his broad eye surveys th’ unequal fight.  
He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain,  
And sends him to redeem th’ abandon’d plain.  
Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,  
And these encourages, and those he chides;  
Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;  
Renews their ardour, and restores the fight.  
“What panic fear has seiz’d your souls? O shame,  
O brand perpetual of th’ Etrurian name!  
Cowards incurable, a woman’s hand  
Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band! </pre></div> </div>
