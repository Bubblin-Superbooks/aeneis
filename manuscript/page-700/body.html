Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac’d,  
Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac’d.  
The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn,  
Now on a naked snag in triumph borne,  
Was hung on high, and glitter’d from afar,  
A trophy sacred to the God of War.  
Above his arms, fix’d on the leafless wood,  
Appear’d his plumy crest, besmear’d with blood:  
His brazen buckler on the left was seen;  
Truncheons of shiver’d lances hung between;  
And on the right was placed his corslet, bor’d;  
And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword.  

A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man,  
Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began:  
“Our toils, my friends, are crown’d with sure success;  
The greater part perform’d, achieve the less. </pre></div> </div>
