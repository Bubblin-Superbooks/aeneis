Attend her curses and avenge her death!  
If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,  
Th’ ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,  
Yet let a race untam’d, and haughty foes,  
His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:  
Oppress’d with numbers in th’ unequal field,  
His men discourag’d, and himself expell’d,  
Let him for succour sue from place to place,  
Torn from his subjects, and his son’s embrace.  
First, let him see his friends in battle slain,  
And their untimely fate lament in vain;  
And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,  
On hard conditions may he buy his peace:  
Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;  
But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,  
And lie unburied on the barren sand!  
These are my pray’rs, and this my dying will; </pre></div> </div>
