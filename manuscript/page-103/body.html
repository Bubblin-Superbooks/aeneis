Spurr’d by my courage, by my country fir’d,  
With sense of honour and revenge inspir’d.  

“Pantheus, Apollo’s priest, a sacred name,  
Had scap’d the Grecian swords, and pass’d the flame:  
With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,  
And by the hand his tender grandson led.  
‘What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?  
Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?’  
Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:  
‘Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!  
The fatal day, th’ appointed hour, is come,  
When wrathful Jove’s irrevocable doom  
Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.  
The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;  
And armed hosts, an unexpected force,  
Break from the bowels of the fatal horse. </pre></div> </div>
