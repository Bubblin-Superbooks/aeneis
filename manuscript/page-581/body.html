And in his body left the broken wood.  
He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,  
And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.  
All stand amaz’d—a second jav’lin flies  
With equal strength, and quivers thro’ the skies.  
This thro’ thy temples, Tagus, forc’d the way,  
And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.  
Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,  
Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,  
Nor knew to fix revenge: “But thou,” he cries,  
“Shalt pay for both,” and at the pris’ner flies  
With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,  
That cruel sight the lover could not bear;  
But from his covert rush’d in open view,  
And sent his voice before him as he flew:  
“Me! me!” he cried—“turn all your swords alone  
On me—the fact confess’d, the fault my own. </pre></div> </div>
