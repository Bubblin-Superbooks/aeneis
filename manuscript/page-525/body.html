To Turnus’ friendly court directs his flight.  
By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,  
With arms, their king to punishment require:  
Their num’rous troops, now muster’d on the strand,  
My counsel shall submit to your command.  
Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry  
To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.  
An ancient augur, skill’d in future fate,  
With these foreboding words restrains their hate:  
‘Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow’r  
Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow’r,  
Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,  
To seek your tyrant’s death by lawful arms;  
Know this: no native of our land may lead  
This pow’rful people; seek a foreign head.’  
Aw’d with these words, in camps they still abide,  
And wait with longing looks their promis’d guide. </pre></div> </div>
