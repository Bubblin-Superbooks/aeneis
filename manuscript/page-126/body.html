She held my hand, the destin’d blow to break;  
Then from her rosy lips began to speak:  
‘My son, from whence this madness, this neglect  
Of my commands, and those whom I protect?  
Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind  
Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.  
Look if your helpless father yet survive,  
Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.  
Around your house the greedy Grecians err;  
And these had perish’d in the nightly war,  
But for my presence and protecting care.  
Not Helen’s face, nor Paris, was in fault;  
But by the gods was this destruction brought.  
Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve  
The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,  
Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see  
The shape of each avenging deity. </pre></div> </div>
