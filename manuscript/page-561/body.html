Then Nisus thus: “Or do the gods inspire  
This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?  
A gen’rous ardour boils within my breast,  
Eager of action, enemy to rest:  
This urges me to fight, and fires my mind  
To leave a memorable name behind.  
Thou see’st the foe secure; how faintly shine  
Their scatter’d fires! the most, in sleep supine  
Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:  
The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;  
All hush’d around. Now hear what I revolve—  
A thought unripe—and scarcely yet resolve.  
Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;  
By message both would hasten his return:  
If they confer what I demand on thee,  
(For fame is recompense enough for me,) </pre></div> </div>
