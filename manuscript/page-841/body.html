Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,  
Which not belies my great forefather’s name!”  

He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed  
Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:  
Fix’d on his wounded face a shaft he bore,  
And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:  
“Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends  
Our last relief: compassionate your friends!  
Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,  
With arms invests, with flames invades the town:  
The brands are toss’d on high; the winds conspire  
To drive along the deluge of the fire.  
All eyes are fix’d on you: your foes rejoice;  
Ev’n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;  
Doubts to deliver or defend the town,  
Whom to reject, or whom to call his son. </pre></div> </div>
