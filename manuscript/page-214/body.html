Attend my counsel, and the secret share.  
When next the Sun his rising light displays,  
And gilds the world below with purple rays,  
The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court  
Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort.  
There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,  
And cheerful horns from side to side resound,  
A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain  
With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;  
The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,  
Dispers’d, and all involv’d in gloomy night;  
One cave a grateful shelter shall afford  
To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.  
I will myself the bridal bed prepare,  
If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:  
So shall their loves be crown’d with due delights,  
And Hymen shall be present at the rites.” </pre></div> </div>
