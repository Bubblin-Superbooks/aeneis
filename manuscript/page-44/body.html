Now, all united in a goodly team,  
They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.  
As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,  
And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;  
Not otherwise your ships, and ev’ry friend,  
Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.  
No more advice is needful; but pursue  
The path before you, and the town in view.”  

Thus having said, she turn’d, and made appear  
Her neck refulgent, and dishevel’d hair,  
Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach’d the ground.  
And widely spread ambrosial scents around:  
In length of train descends her sweeping gown;  
And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known. </pre></div> </div>
