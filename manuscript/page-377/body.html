In vain he thus attempts her mind to move  
With tears, and pray’rs, and late-repenting love.  
Disdainfully she look’d; then turning round,  
But fix’d her eyes unmov’d upon the ground,  
And what he says and swears, regards no more  
Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;  
But whirl’d away, to shun his hateful sight,  
Hid in the forest and the shades of night;  
Then sought Sichaeus thro’ the shady grove,  
Who answer’d all her cares, and equal’d all her love.  

Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,  
And follow’d with his eyes the flitting shade,  
Then took the forward way, by fate ordain’d,  
And, with his guide, the farther fields attain’d,  
Where, sever’d from the rest, the warrior souls remain’d. </pre></div> </div>
