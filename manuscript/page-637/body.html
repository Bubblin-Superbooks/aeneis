With pleasing words to warn th’ unknowing man:  
“Sleeps our lov’d lord? O goddess-born, awake!  
Spread ev’ry sail, pursue your wat’ry track,  
And haste your course. Your navy once were we,  
From Ida’s height descending to the sea;  
Till Turnus, as at anchor fix’d we stood,  
Presum’d to violate our holy wood.  
Then, loos’d from shore, we fled his fires profane  
(Unwillingly we broke our master’s chain),  
And since have sought you thro’ the Tuscan main.  
The mighty Mother chang’d our forms to these,  
And gave us life immortal in the seas.  
But young Ascanius, in his camp distress’d,  
By your insulting foes is hardly press’d.  
Th’ Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,  
Advance in order on the Latian coast:  
To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, </pre></div> </div>
