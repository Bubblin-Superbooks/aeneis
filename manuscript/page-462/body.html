Fix’d in his throat the flying weapon stood,  
And stopp’d his breath, and drank his vital blood  
Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:  
Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;  
A good old man, while peace he preach’d in vain,  
Amidst the madness of th’ unruly train:  
Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill’d;  
His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till’d.  

Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood  
The Fury bath’d them in each other’s blood;  
Then, having fix’d the fight, exulting flies,  
And bears fulfill’d her promise to the skies.  
To Juno thus she speaks: “Behold! It is done,  
The blood already drawn, the war begun;  
The discord is complete; nor can they cease  
The dire debate, nor you command the peace. </pre></div> </div>
