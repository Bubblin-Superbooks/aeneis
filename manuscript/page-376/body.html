(Doubtful as he who sees, thro’ dusky night,  
Or thinks he sees, the moon’s uncertain light,)  
With tears he first approach’d the sullen shade;  
And, as his love inspir’d him, thus he said:  
“Unhappy queen! then is the common breath  
Of rumour true, in your reported death,  
And I, alas! the cause? By Heav’n, I vow,  
And all the pow’rs that rule the realms below,  
Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,  
Commanded by the gods, and forc’d by fate.  
Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might  
Have sent me to these regions void of light,  
Thro’ the vast empire of eternal night.  
Nor dar’d I to presume, that, press’d with grief,  
My flight should urge you to this dire relief.  
Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:  
’Tis the last interview that fate allows!” </pre></div> </div>
