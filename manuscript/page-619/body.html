This endless outrage shall they still sustain?  
Shall Troy renew’d be forc’d and fir’d again?  
A second siege my banish’d issue fears,  
And a new Diomede in arms appears.  
One more audacious mortal will be found;  
And I, thy daughter, wait another wound.  
Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,  
The Latian lands my progeny receive,  
Bear they the pains of violated law,  
And thy protection from their aid withdraw.  
But, if the gods their sure success foretell;  
If those of heav’n consent with those of hell,  
To promise Italy; who dare debate  
The pow’r of Jove, or fix another fate?  
What should I tell of tempests on the main,  
Of Aeolus usurping Neptune’s reign?  
Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat </pre></div> </div>
