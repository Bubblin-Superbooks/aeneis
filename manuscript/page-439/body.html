Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,  
I add to his commands my own request:  
One only daughter heirs my crown and state,  
Whom not our oracles, nor Heav’n, nor fate,  
Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join  
With any native of th’ Ausonian line.  
A foreign son-in-law shall come from far  
(Such is our doom), a chief renown’d in war,  
Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,  
And thro’ the conquer’d world diffuse our fame.  
Himself to be the man the fates require,  
I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire.”

Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,  
Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress’d:  
Of these he chose the fairest and the best, </pre></div> </div>
