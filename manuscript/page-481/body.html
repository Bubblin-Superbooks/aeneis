Hippolytus, as old records have said,  
Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed;  
But, when no female arts his mind could move,  
She turn’d to furious hate her impious love.  
Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,  
Another’s crimes th’ unhappy hunter bore,  
Glutting his father’s eyes with guiltless gore.  
But chaste Diana, who his death deplor’d,  
With Aesculapian herbs his life restor’d.  
Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,  
The dead inspir’d with vital breath again,  
Struck to the centre, with his flaming dart,  
Th’ unhappy founder of the godlike art.  
But Trivia kept in secret shades alone  
Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;  
And call’d him Virbius in th’ Egerian grove,  
Where then he liv’d obscure, but safe from Jove. </pre></div> </div>
