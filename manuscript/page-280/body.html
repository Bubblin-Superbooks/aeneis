Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.  
The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,  
And aid with eager shouts the favour’d side.  
Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound,  
From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.  

Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,  
Gyas outstripp’d the rest, and sprung before:  
Cloanthus, better mann’d, pursued him fast,  
But his o’er-masted galley check’d his haste.  
The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine  
With equal oars, advancing in a line;  
And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,  
And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;  
Now board to board the rival vessels row,  
The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.  
They reach’d the mark; proud Gyas and his train </pre></div> </div>
