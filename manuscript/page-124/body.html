Leap’d headlong from the heights; the flames consum’d the rest.  
Thus, wand’ring in my way, without a guide,  
The graceless Helen in the porch I spied  
Of Vesta’s temple; there she lurk’d alone;  
Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:  
But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,  
That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.  
For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;  
More dreads the vengeance of her injur’d lord;  
Ev’n by those gods who refug’d her abhorr’d.  
Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,  
Resolv’d to give her guilt the due reward:  
‘Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,  
And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?  
Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,  
In state attended with a captive crew, </pre></div> </div>
