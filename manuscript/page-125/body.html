While unreveng’d the good old Priam falls,  
And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?  
For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood  
Were swell’d with bodies, and were drunk with blood?  
’Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain,  
And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:  
Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,  
Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;  
The punish’d crime shall set my soul at ease,  
And murm’ring manes of my friends appease.’  
Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light  
Spread o’er the place; and, shining heav’nly bright,  
My mother stood reveal’d before my sight  
Never so radiant did her eyes appear;  
Not her own star confess’d a light so clear:  
Great in her charms, as when on gods above  
She looks, and breathes herself into their love. </pre></div> </div>
