When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,  
And clatt’ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;  
They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,  
And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind.  
Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,  
New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,  
Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,  
Where tufted trees a native arbour made.  
Again the holy fires on altars burn;  
And once again the rav’nous birds return,  
Or from the dark recesses where they lie,  
Or from another quarter of the sky;  
With filthy claws their odious meal repeat,  
And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat.  
I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,  
And with the hellish nation wage the war.  
They, as commanded, for the fight provide, </pre></div> </div>
