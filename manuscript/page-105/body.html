Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew  
My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;  
With young Coroebus, who by love was led  
To win renown and fair Cassandra’s bed,  
And lately brought his troops to Priam’s aid,  
Forewarn’d in vain by the prophetic maid.  
Whom when I saw resolv’d in arms to fall,  
And that one spirit animated all:  
‘Brave souls!’ said I, ‘but brave, alas! in vain:  
Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.  
You see the desp’rate state of our affairs,  
And heav’n’s protecting pow’rs are deaf to pray’rs.  
The passive gods behold the Greeks defile  
Their temples, and abandon to the spoil  
Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire  
To save a sinking town, involv’d in fire.  
Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: </pre></div> </div>
