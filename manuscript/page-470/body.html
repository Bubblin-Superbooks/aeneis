All these of old were places of renown.  
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;  
Some twine young sallows to support the shield;  
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mould,  
With silver plated, and with ductile gold.  
The rustic honours of the scythe and share  
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.  
Old falchions are new temper’d in the fires;  
The sounding trumpet ev’ry soul inspires.  
The word is giv’n; with eager speed they lace  
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.  
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;  
The trusty weapon sits on ev’ry side.  

And now the mighty labour is begun  
Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.  
Sing you the chiefs that sway’d th’ Ausonian land, </pre></div> </div>
