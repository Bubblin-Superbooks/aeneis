My dying son contracted no such band;  
The gift is hateful from his murd’rer’s hand.  
For this, this only favour let me sue,  
If pity can to conquer’d foes be due:  
Refuse it not; but let my body have  
The last retreat of humankind, a grave.  
Too well I know th’ insulting people’s hate;  
Protect me from their vengeance after fate:  
This refuge for my poor remains provide,  
And lay my much-lov’d Lausus by my side.”  
He said, and to the sword his throat applied.  
The crimson stream distain’d his arms around,  
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro’ the wound.  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
