With twenty horse to second his designs,  
An unexpected foe, he fac’d the lines.  
“Is there,” he said, “in arms, who bravely dare  
His leader’s honour and his danger share?”  
Then spurring on, his brandish’d dart he threw,  
In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.  

Amaz’d to find a dastard race, that run  
Behind the rampires and the battle shun,  
He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,  
And stops at ev’ry post, and ev’ry passage tries.  
So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:  
Wet with descending show’rs, and stiff with cold,  
He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,  
(His gnashing teeth are exercis’d in vain,)  
And, impotent of anger, finds no way  
In his distended paws to grasp the prey. </pre></div> </div>
