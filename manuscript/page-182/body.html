Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,  
Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.  

“The prophet bless’d the parting crew, and last,  
With words like these, his ancient friend embrac’d:  
‘Old happy man, the care of gods above,  
Whom heav’nly Venus honour’d with her love,  
And twice preserv’d thy life, when Troy was lost,  
Behold from far the wish’d Ausonian coast:  
There land; but take a larger compass round,  
For that before is all forbidden ground.  
The shore that Phoebus has design’d for you,  
At farther distance lies, conceal’d from view.  
Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes,  
Blest in a son, and favour’d by the gods:  
For I with useless words prolong your stay,  
When southern gales have summon’d you away.’ </pre></div> </div>
