Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise  
The fall’n companion of his youthful days.  
Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return’d;  
With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn’d.  
Disdain and conscious virtue fir’d his breast,  
And with redoubled force his foe he press’d.  
He lays on load with either hand, amain,  
And headlong drives the Trojan o’er the plain;  
Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;  
But storms of strokes descend about his brows,  
A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.  
But now the prince, who saw the wild increase  
Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,  
And bounds Entellus’ wrath, and bids the peace.  
First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,  
And sooth’d his sorrow for the suffer’d shame. </pre></div> </div>
