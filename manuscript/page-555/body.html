With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,  
With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,  
Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,  
Loos’d from your crooked anchors, launch at large,  
Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,  
And swim the seas, at Cybele’s command.”  
No sooner had the goddess ceas’d to speak,  
When, lo! th’ obedient ships their haulsers break;  
And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main  
They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:  
As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,  
As rode before tall vessels on the deep.  

The foes, surpris’d with wonder, stood aghast;  
Messapus curb’d his fiery courser’s haste;  
Old Tiber roar’d, and, raising up his head,  
Call’d back his waters to their oozy bed. </pre></div> </div>
