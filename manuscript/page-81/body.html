And trembling in the hollow belly stood.  
The sides, transpierc’d, return a rattling sound,  
And groans of Greeks inclos’d come issuing thro’ the wound  
And, had not Heav’n the fall of Troy design’d,  
Or had not men been fated to be blind,  
Enough was said and done t’inspire a better mind.  
Then had our lances pierc’d the treach’rous wood,  
And Ilian tow’rs and Priam’s empire stood.  
Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring  
A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;  
Taken to take; who made himself their prey,  
T’ impose on their belief, and Troy betray;  
Fix’d on his aim, and obstinately bent  
To die undaunted, or to circumvent.  
About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;  
All press to see, and some insult the foe. </pre></div> </div>
