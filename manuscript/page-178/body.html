But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,  
The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,  
Then dashes on the rocks. A human face,  
And virgin bosom, hides her tail’s disgrace:  
Her parts obscene below the waves descend,  
With dogs inclos’d, and in a dolphin end.  
’Tis safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,  
And coast Pachynus, tho’ with more delay,  
Than once to view misshapen Scylla near,  
And the loud yell of wat’ry wolves to hear.  

“‘Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,  
And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true,  
Do not this precept of your friend forget,  
Which therefore more than once I must repeat:  
Above the rest, great Juno’s name adore;  
Pay vows to Juno; Juno’s aid implore. </pre></div> </div>
