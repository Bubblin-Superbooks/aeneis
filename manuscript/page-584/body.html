Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:  
Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;  
And the yet reeking blood o’erflows the ground.  
All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,  
But mourn’d a purchase that so dear had cost.  
Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon’s bed,  
And with the dawn of day the skies o’erspread;  
Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,  
But added colours to the world reveal’d:  
When early Turnus, wak’ning with the light,  
All clad in armour, calls his troops to fight.  
His martial men with fierce harangue he fir’d,  
And his own ardour in their souls inspir’d.  
This done—to give new terror to his foes,  
The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,  
Rais’d high on pointed spears—a ghastly sight:  
Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight. </pre></div> </div>
