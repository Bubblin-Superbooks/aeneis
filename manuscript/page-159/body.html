“Astonish’d at their voices and their sight,  
(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;  
I saw, I knew their faces, and descried,  
In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)  
I started from my couch; a clammy sweat  
On all my limbs and shiv’ring body sate.  
To heav’n I lift my hands with pious haste,  
And sacred incense in the flames I cast.  
Thus to the gods their perfect honours done,  
More cheerful, to my good old sire I run,  
And tell the pleasing news. In little space  
He found his error of the double race;  
Not, as before he deem’d, deriv’d from Crete;  
No more deluded by the doubtful seat:  
Then said: ‘O son, turmoil’d in Trojan fate!  
Such things as these Cassandra did relate. </pre></div> </div>
