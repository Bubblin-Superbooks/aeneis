And to the Capitol his chariot guide,  
From conquer’d Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils.  
And yet another, fam’d for warlike toils,  
On Argos shall impose the Roman laws,  
And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause;  
Shall drag in chains their Achillean race;  
Shall vindicate his ancestors’ disgrace,  
And Pallas, for her violated place.  
Great Cato there, for gravity renown’d,  
And conqu’ring Cossus goes with laurels crown’d.  
Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare  
The Scipios’ worth, those thunderbolts of war,  
The double bane of Carthage? Who can see  
Without esteem for virtuous poverty,  
Severe Fabricius, or can cease t’ admire  
The plowman consul in his coarse attire?  
Tir’d as I am, my praise the Fabii claim; </pre></div> </div>
