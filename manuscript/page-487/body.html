If fortune favour’d his first enterprise,  
Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,  
And common interest, was involv’d in theirs.”  

While Turnus and th’ allies thus urge the war,  
The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,  
Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.  
This way and that he turns his anxious mind;  
Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design’d;  
Explores himself in vain, in ev’ry part,  
And gives no rest to his distracted heart.  
So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,  
Strike on the polish’d brass their trembling light,  
The glitt’ring species here and there divide,  
And cast their dubious beams from side to side;  
Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,  
And to the ceiling flash the glaring day. </pre></div> </div>
