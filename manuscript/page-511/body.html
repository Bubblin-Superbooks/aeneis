Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took  
Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.  
Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care  
Of lab’ring oxen, or the shining share,  
Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain’d to spare.  
Their exercise the chase; the running flood  
Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.  
Then Saturn came, who fled the pow’r of Jove,  
Robb’d of his realms, and banish’d from above.  
The men, dispers’d on hills, to towns he brought,  
And laws ordain’d, and civil customs taught,  
And Latium call’d the land where safe he lay  
From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.  
With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;  
And hence the golden times deriv’d their name.  
A more degenerate and discolour’d age  
Succeeded this, with avarice and rage. </pre></div> </div>
