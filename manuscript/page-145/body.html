And Priam’s throne, by too severe a fate;  
When ruin’d Troy became the Grecians’ prey,  
And Ilium’s lofty tow’rs in ashes lay;  
Warn’d by celestial omens, we retreat,  
To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.  
Near old Antandros, and at Ida’s foot,  
The timber of the sacred groves we cut,  
And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find  
What place the gods for our repose assign’d.  
Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring  
Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,  
When old Anchises summon’d all to sea:  
The crew my father and the Fates obey.  
With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,  
And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.  
My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,  
All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods. </pre></div> </div>
