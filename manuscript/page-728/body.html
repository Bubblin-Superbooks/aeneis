The murmur ceas’d: then from his lofty throne  
The king invok’d the gods, and thus begun:  
“I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate  
Had been resolv’d before it was too late.  
Much better had it been for you and me,  
Unforc’d by this our last necessity,  
To have been earlier wise, than now to call  
A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.  
O citizens, we wage unequal war,  
With men not only Heav’n’s peculiar care,  
But Heav’n’s own race; unconquer’d in the field,  
Or, conquer’d, yet unknowing how to yield.  
What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:  
Our hopes must centre on ourselves alone.  
Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,  
You see too well; nor need my words explain. </pre></div> </div>
