And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.  
The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,  
To bless their rival sons with such a bride;  
But she disdains their love, to share with me  
The sylvan shades and vow’d virginity.  
And, O! I wish, contented with my cares  
Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!  
Then had she been of my celestial train,  
And shunn’d the fate that dooms her to be slain.  
But since, opposing Heav’n’s decree, she goes  
To find her death among forbidden foes,  
Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.  
Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.  
This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,  
This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:  
By whate’er hand Camilla shall be slain,  
Or of the Trojan or Italian train, </pre></div> </div>
