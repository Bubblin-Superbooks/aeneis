And shiver’d lances gather’d from the plain.  
Whole herds of offer’d bulls, about the fire,  
And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.  
Around the piles a careful troop attends,  
To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;  
Ling’ring along the shore, till dewy night  
New decks the face of heav’n with starry light.  

The conquer’d Latians, with like pious care,  
Piles without number for their dead prepare.  
## Part in the places where they fell are laid;  
And part are to the neighb’ring fields convey’d.  
The corps of kings, and captains of renown,  
Borne off in state, are buried in the town;  
The rest, unhonour’d, and without a name,  
Are cast a common heap to feed the flame. </pre></div> </div>
