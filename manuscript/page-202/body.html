Here, after endless labours, often toss’d  
By raging storms, and driv’n on ev’ry coast,  
My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost:  
Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain,  
Sav’d thro’ a thousand toils, but sav’d in vain  
The prophet, who my future woes reveal’d,  
Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal’d;  
And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill  
Denounc’d all else, was silent of the ill.  
This my last labour was. Some friendly god  
From thence convey’d us to your blest abode.”  

Thus, to the list’ning queen, the royal guest  
His wand’ring course and all his toils express’d;  
And here concluding, he retir’d to rest.  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
