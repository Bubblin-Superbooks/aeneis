And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.  
From this ill-omen’d hour in time arose  
Debate and death, and all succeeding woes.  

The queen, whom sense of honour could not move,  
No longer made a secret of her love,  
But call’d it marriage, by that specious name  
To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.  

The loud report thro’ Libyan cities goes.  
Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:  
Swift from the first; and ev’ry moment brings  
New vigour to her flights, new pinions to her wings.  
Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;  
Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies.  
Inrag’d against the gods, revengeful Earth  
Produc’d her last of the Titanian birth. </pre></div> </div>
