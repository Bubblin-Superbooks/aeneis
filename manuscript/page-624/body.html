Petition, while you public arms prepare;  
Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!  
’Twas giv’n to you, your darling son to shroud,  
To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd,  
And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud.  
From flaming fleets you turn’d the fire away,  
And chang’d the ships to daughters of the sea.  
But is my crime—the Queen of Heav’n offends,  
If she presume to save her suff’ring friends!  
Your son, not knowing what his foes decree,  
You say, is absent: absent let him be.  
Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow’rs,  
The soft recesses, and the sacred bow’rs.  
Why do you then these needless arms prepare,  
And thus provoke a people prone to war?  
Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,  
Or hinder from return your exil’d race? </pre></div> </div>
