And wing’d his flight, to chant aloft in air.  
His son Cupavo brush’d the briny flood:  
Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood,  
Who heav’d a rock, and, threat’ning still to throw,  
With lifted hands alarm’d the seas below:  
They seem’d to fear the formidable sight,  
And roll’d their billows on, to speed his flight.  

Ocnus was next, who led his native train  
Of hardy warriors thro’ the wat’ry plain:  
The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream,  
From whence the Mantuan town derives the name—  
An ancient city, but of mix’d descent:  
Three sev’ral tribes compose the government;  
Four towns are under each; but all obey  
The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway. </pre></div> </div>
