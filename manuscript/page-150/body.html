Relate the prodigies of Heav’n, require  
What he commands, and their advice desire.  
All vote to leave that execrable shore,  
Polluted with the blood of Polydore;  
But, ere we sail, his fun’ral rites prepare,  
Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.  
In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,  
With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown’d,  
With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.  
Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,  
And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.  

“Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,  
But southern gales invite us to the main,  
We launch our vessels, with a prosp’rous wind,  
And leave the cities and the shores behind. </pre></div> </div>
