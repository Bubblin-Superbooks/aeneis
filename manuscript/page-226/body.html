With rapid force they bear him down the skies.  
But first he grasps within his awful hand  
The mark of sov’reign pow’r, his magic wand;  
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;  
With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;  
With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,  
And eyes, tho’ clos’d in death, restores to light.  
Thus arm’d, the god begins his airy race,  
And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;  
Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,  
Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;  
Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown’d,  
Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.  
Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin  
The founts of rolling streams their race begin;  
A beard of ice on his large breast depends.  
Here, pois’d upon his wings, the god descends: </pre></div> </div>
