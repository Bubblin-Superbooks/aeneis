His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,  
And loud applauses echo thro’ the field.  
Dares alone in combat us’d to stand  
The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;  
The same, at Hector’s fun’rals, undertook  
Gigantic Butes, of th’ Amycian stock,  
And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,  
Stretch’d the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.  
Such Dares was; and such he strode along,  
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.  
His brawny back and ample breast he shows,  
His lifted arms around his head he throws,  
And deals in whistling air his empty blows.  
His match is sought; but, thro’ the trembling band,  
Not one dares answer to the proud demand.  
Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes  
Already he devours the promis’d prize. </pre></div> </div>
