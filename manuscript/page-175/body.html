Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:  
For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,  
And stem the currents with your struggling oars;  
Then round th’ Italian coast your navy steer;  
And, after this, to Circe’s island veer;  
And, last, before your new foundations rise,  
Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.  
Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,  
And bear them safely treasur’d in thy breast.  
When, in the shady shelter of a wood,  
And near the margin of a gentle flood,  
Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,  
With thirty sucking young encompass’d round;  
The dam and offspring white as falling snow:  
These on thy city shall their name bestow,  
And there shall end thy labours and thy woe.  
Nor let the threaten’d famine fright thy mind, </pre></div> </div>
