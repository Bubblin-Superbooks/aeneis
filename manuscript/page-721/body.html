While thus their factious minds with fury burn,  
The legates from th’ Aetolian prince return:  
Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost  
And care employ’d, their embassy is lost;  
That Diomedes refus’d his aid in war,  
Unmov’d with presents, and as deaf to pray’r.  
Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,  
Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.  

Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,  
A foreign son is pointed out by fate;  
And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,  
The wrath of Heav’n is hov’ring o’er his head.  
The gods, he saw, espous’d the juster side,  
When late their titles in the field were tried:  
Witness the fresh laments, and fun’ral tears undried. </pre></div> </div>
