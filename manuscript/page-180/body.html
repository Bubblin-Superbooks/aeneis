Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.  
Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid  
The madness of the visionary maid,  
And with loud curses leave the mystic shade.  

“‘Think it not loss of time a while to stay,  
Tho’ thy companions chide thy long delay;  
Tho’ summon’d to the seas, tho’ pleasing gales  
Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails:  
But beg the sacred priestess to relate  
With willing words, and not to write thy fate.  
The fierce Italian people she will show,  
And all thy wars, and all thy future woe,  
And what thou may’st avoid, and what must undergo.  
She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind,  
And teach thee how the happy shores to find.  
This is what Heav’n allows me to relate: </pre></div> </div>
