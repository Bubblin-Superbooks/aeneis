For ornament the Trojan hero brought,  
Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.  
One vest array’d the corpse; and one they spread  
O’er his clos’d eyes, and wrapp’d around his head,  
That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,  
The catching fire might burn the golden caul.  
Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,  
When he descended on the Latian plain;  
Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led  
In long array—th’ achievements of the dead.  
Then, pinion’d with their hands behind, appear  
Th’ unhappy captives, marching in the rear,  
Appointed off’rings in the victor’s name,  
To sprinkle with their blood the fun’ral flame.  
Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;  
Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;  
And fair inscriptions fix’d, and titles read </pre></div> </div>
