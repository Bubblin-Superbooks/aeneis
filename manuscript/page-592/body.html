Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:  
No marks of honour charg’d its empty field.  
Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,  
And rising, found himself amidst his foes;  
Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way.  
Embolden’d by despair, he stood at bay;  
And, like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds  
Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds  
Resolv’d on death, he dissipates his fears,  
And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:  
So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws  
His dying body on his thickest foes.  
But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,  
Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;  
Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,  
And snatches at the beam he first can find;  
Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch, </pre></div> </div>
