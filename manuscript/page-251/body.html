<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">ground  
The flocks and herds, and party-colour’d fowl,  
Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,  
Stretch’d on the quiet earth, securely lay,  
Forgetting the past labours of the day.  
All else of nature’s common gift partake:  
Unhappy Dido was alone awake.  
Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;  
Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind.  
Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;  
Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.  

Then thus she said within her secret mind:  
“What shall I do? what succour can I find?  
Become a suppliant to Hyarba’s pride,  
And take my turn, to court and be denied?  
Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,  
Forsake an empire, and attend a foe? </pre></div> </div>
