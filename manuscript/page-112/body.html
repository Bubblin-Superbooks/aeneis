Oppress’d with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,  
At Pallas’ altar, by Peneleus pierc’d.  
Then Ripheus follow’d, in th’ unequal fight;  
Just of his word, observant of the right:  
Heav’n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,  
With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.  
Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy mitre, nor the bands  
Of awful Phoebus, sav’d from impious hands.  
Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,  
What I perform’d, and what I suffer’d there;  
No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,  
Expos’d to death, and prodigal of life;  
Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:  
I strove to have deserv’d the death I sought.  
But, when I could not fight, and would have died,  
Borne off to distance by the growing tide,  
Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence, </pre></div> </div>
