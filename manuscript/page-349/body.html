Enjoin’d to seek, below, his holy shade;  
Conducted there by your unerring aid.  
But you, if pious minds by pray’rs are won,  
Oblige the father, and protect the son.  
Yours is the pow’r; nor Proserpine in vain  
Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.  
If Orpheus, arm’d with his enchanting lyre,  
The ruthless king with pity could inspire,  
And from the shades below redeem his wife;  
If Pollux, off’ring his alternate life,  
Could free his brother, and can daily go  
By turns aloft, by turns descend below:  
Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,  
Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?  
Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;  
My mother greater, my descent the same.” </pre></div> </div>
