Pallas th’ encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,  
To Tuscan Tiber thus address’d his vows:  
“O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,  
And give to pass the proud Halesus’ heart!  
His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear.”  
Pleas’d with the bribe, the god receiv’d his pray’r:  
For, while his shield protects a friend distress’d,  
The dart came driving on, and pierc’d his breast.  

But Lausus, no small portion of the war,  
Permits not panic fear to reign too far,  
Caus’d by the death of so renown’d a knight;  
But by his own example cheers the fight.  
Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay  
Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.  
The Phrygian troops escap’d the Greeks in vain:  
They, and their mix’d allies, now load the plain. </pre></div> </div>
