In this distress be present to my pray’r!”  
Thus having said, he stopp’d with watchful sight,  
Observing still the motions of their flight,  
What course they took, what happy signs they shew.  
They fed, and, flutt’ring, by degrees withdrew  
Still farther from the place, but still in view:  
Hopping and flying, thus they led him on  
To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun  
They wing’d their flight aloft; then, stooping low,  
Perch’d on the double tree that bears the golden bough.  
Thro’ the green leafs the glitt’ring shadows glow;  
As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,  
Where the proud mother views her precious brood,  
And happier branches, which she never sow’d.  
Such was the glitt’ring; such the ruddy rind,  
And dancing leaves, that wanton’d in the wind. </pre></div> </div>
