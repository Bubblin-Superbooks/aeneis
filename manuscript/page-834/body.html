This day the Latian tow’rs, that mate the sky,  
Shall level with the plain in ashes lie:  
The people shall be slaves, unless in time  
They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.  
Twice have our foes been vanquish’d on the plain:  
Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?  
Your force against the perjur’d city bend.  
There it began, and there the war shall end.  
The peace profan’d our rightful arms requires;  
Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires.”  

He finish’d; and, one soul inspiring all,  
Form’d in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.  
Without the town, an unprovided train  
Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain.  
Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear,  
And those they toss aloft, and these they rear: </pre></div> </div>
