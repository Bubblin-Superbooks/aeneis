Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.  
This active mind, infus’d thro’ all the space,  
Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.  
Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,  
And birds of air, and monsters of the main.  
Th’ ethereal vigour is in all the same,  
And every soul is fill’d with equal flame;  
As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay  
Of mortal members, subject to decay,  
Blunt not the beams of heav’n and edge of day.  
From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,  
Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,  
And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,  
In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin’d,  
Assert the native skies, or own its heav’nly kind:  
Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;  
But long-contracted filth ev’n in the soul remains. </pre></div> </div>
