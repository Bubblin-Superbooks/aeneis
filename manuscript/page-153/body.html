Through the wide world th’ Aeneian house shall reign,  
And children’s children shall the crown sustain.’  
Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:  
A mighty tumult, mix’d with joy, arose.  

“All are concern’d to know what place the god  
Assign’d, and where determin’d our abode.  
My father, long revolving in his mind  
The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,  
Thus answer’d their demands: ‘Ye princes, hear  
Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.  
The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,  
Sacred of old to Jove’s imperial name,  
In the mid ocean lies, with large command,  
And on its plains a hundred cities stand.  
Another Ida rises there, and we  
From thence derive our Trojan ancestry. </pre></div> </div>
