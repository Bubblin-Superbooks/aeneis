When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought,  
And how the rivals lov’d, and how they fought.  
These are my theme, and how the war began,  
And how concluded by the godlike man:  
For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,  
Which princes and their people did engage;  
And haughty souls, that, mov’d with mutual hate,  
In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;  
That rous’d the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,  
And peaceful Italy involv’d in arms.  
A larger scene of action is display’d;  
And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh’d.  

Latinus, old and mild, had long possess’d  
The Latin scepter, and his people blest:  
His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame  
His mother; fair Marica was her name. </pre></div> </div>
