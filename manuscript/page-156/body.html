Full on the promis’d land at length we bore,  
With joy descending on the Cretan shore.  
With eager haste a rising town I frame,  
Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:  
The name itself was grateful; I exhort  
To found their houses, and erect a fort.  
Our ships are haul’d upon the yellow strand;  
The youth begin to till the labour’d land;  
And I myself new marriages promote,  
Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;  
When rising vapours choke the wholesome air,  
And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year;  
The trees devouring caterpillars burn;  
Parch’d was the grass, and blighted was the corn:  
Nor ’scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,  
With pestilential heat infects the sky:  
My men, some fall, the rest in fevers fry. </pre></div> </div>
