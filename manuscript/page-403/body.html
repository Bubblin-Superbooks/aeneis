Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear;  
Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found;  
And raise Collatian tow’rs on rocky ground.  
All these shall then be towns of mighty fame,  
Tho’ now they lie obscure, and lands without a name.  
See Romulus the great, born to restore  
The crown that once his injur’d grandsire wore.  
This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear,  
And like his sire in arms he shall appear.  
Two rising crests, his royal head adorn;  
Born from a god, himself to godhead born:  
His sire already signs him for the skies,  
And marks the seat amidst the deities.  
Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come,  
Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome.  
Rome, whose ascending tow’rs shall heav’n invade,  
Involving earth and ocean in her shade; </pre></div> </div>
