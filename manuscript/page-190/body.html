And those the promis’d rocks! Bear off to sea!’  
With haste the frighted mariners obey.  
First Palinurus to the larboard veer’d;  
Then all the fleet by his example steer’d.  
To heav’n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,  
Then down to hell descend, when they divide;  
And thrice our galleys knock’d the stony ground,  
And thrice the hollow rocks return’d the sound,  
And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.  
The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;  
And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.  
The port capacious, and secure from wind,  
Is to the foot of thund’ring Aetna join’d.  
By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;  
By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,  
And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. </pre></div> </div>
