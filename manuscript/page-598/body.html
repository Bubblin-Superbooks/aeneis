To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.  
Our youth, of labour patient, earn their bread;  
Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed.  
From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,  
They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.  
No part of life from toils of war is free,  
No change in age, or diff’rence in degree.  
We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,  
Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel;  
Th’ inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.  
Ev’n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:  
The body, not the mind; nor can control  
Th’ immortal vigour, or abate the soul.  
Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:  
We live by plunder, and delight in prey.  
Your vests embroider’d with rich purple shine;  
In sloth you glory, and in dances join. </pre></div> </div>
