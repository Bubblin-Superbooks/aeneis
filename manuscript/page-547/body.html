That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.  
Aeneas, gone to seek th’ Arcadian prince,  
Has left the Trojan camp without defence;  
And, short of succours there, employs his pains  
In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.  
Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs;  
Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.”  
This said, on equal wings she pois’d her weight,  
And form’d a radiant rainbow in her flight.  

The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes,  
And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:  
“Iris, the grace of heav’n, what pow’r divine  
Has sent thee down, thro’ dusky clouds to shine?  
See, they divide; immortal day appears,  
And glitt’ring planets dancing in their spheres!  
With joy, these happy omens I obey, </pre></div> </div>
