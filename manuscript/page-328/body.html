With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.  
Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,  
Reveal’d his vision, and the gods’ intent,  
With his own purpose. All, without delay,  
The will of Jove, and his desires obey.  
They list with women each degenerate name,  
Who dares not hazard life for future fame.  
These they cashier: the brave remaining few,  
Oars, banks, and cables, half consum’d, renew.  
The prince designs a city with the plow;  
The lots their sev’ral tenements allow.  
This part is nam’d from Ilium, that from Troy,  
And the new king ascends the throne with joy;  
A chosen senate from the people draws;  
Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.  
Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin  
A rising temple to the Paphian queen. </pre></div> </div>
