Vanquish’d without resource; laid flat by fate;  
Factions within, a foe without the gate!  
Not but I grant that all perform’d their parts  
With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:  
With our united strength the war we wag’d;  
With equal numbers, equal arms, engag’d.  
You see th’ event.—Now hear what I propose,  
To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.  
A tract of land the Latins have possess’d  
Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,  
Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,  
And their mix’d cattle graze the fruitful hill.  
Those mountains fill’d with firs, that lower land,  
If you consent, the Trojan shall command,  
Call’d into part of what is ours; and there,  
On terms agreed, the common country share.  
There let them build and settle, if they please; </pre></div> </div>
