Now follow cheerful to the trembling town;  
Press but an entrance, and presume it won.  
Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies,  
As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice.  
Turnus shall fall extended on the plain,  
And, in this omen, is already slain.  
Prepar’d in arms, pursue your happy chance;  
That none unwarn’d may plead his ignorance,  
And I, at Heav’n’s appointed hour, may find  
Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.  
Meantime the rites and fun’ral pomps prepare,  
Due to your dead companions of the war:  
The last respect the living can bestow,  
To shield their shadows from contempt below.  
That conquer’d earth be theirs, for which they fought,  
And which for us with their own blood they bought;  
But first the corpse of our unhappy friend </pre></div> </div>
