Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;  
Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!  
Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!  
I sav’d the shipwreck’d exile on my shore;  
With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;  
I took the traitor to my throne and bed:  
Fool that I was—— ’tis little to repeat  
The rest, I stor’d and rigg’d his ruin’d fleet.  
I rave, I rave! A god’s command he pleads,  
And makes Heav’n accessary to his deeds.  
Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,  
Now Hermes is employ’d from Jove’s abode,  
To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state  
Of heav’nly pow’rs were touch’d with human fate!  
But go! thy flight no longer I detain;  
Go seek thy promis’d kingdom thro’ the main!  
Yet, if the heav’ns will hear my pious vow, </pre></div> </div>
