Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,  
Welt’ring in blood, each other’s arms infold?  
Haste! gird my sword, tho’ spent and overcome:  
’Tis the last summons to receive our doom.  
I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!  
Not unreveng’d the foe shall see my fall.  
Restore me to the yet unfinish’d fight:  
My death is wanting to conclude the night.’  
Arm’d once again, my glitt’ring sword I wield,  
While th’ other hand sustains my weighty shield,  
And forth I rush to seek th’ abandon’d field.  
I went; but sad Creusa stopp’d my way,  
And cross the threshold in my passage lay,  
Embrac’d my knees, and, when I would have gone,  
Shew’d me my feeble sire and tender son:  
‘If death be your design, at least,’ said she,  
‘Take us along to share your destiny. </pre></div> </div>
