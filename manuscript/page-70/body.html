Lull’d in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,  
She gently bears him to her blissful groves,  
Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,  
And softly lays him on a flow’ry bed.  
Cupid meantime assum’d his form and face,  
Foll’wing Achates with a shorter pace,  
And brought the gifts. The queen already sate  
Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,  
High on a golden bed: her princely guest  
Was next her side; in order sate the rest.  
Then canisters with bread are heap’d on high;  
Th’ attendants water for their hands supply,  
And, having wash’d, with silken towels dry.  
Next fifty handmaids in long order bore  
The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:  
Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join  
To place the dishes, and to serve the wine. </pre></div> </div>
