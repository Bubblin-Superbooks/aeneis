She said, and swiftly vanish’d from my sight,  
Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.  
I look’d, I listen’d; dreadful sounds I hear;  
And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.  
Troy sunk in flames I saw, nor could prevent;  
And Ilium from its old foundations rent;  
Rent like a mountain ash, which dar’d the winds,  
And stood the sturdy strokes of lab’ring hinds.  
About the roots the cruel ax resounds;  
The stumps are pierc’d with oft-repeated wounds:  
The war is felt on high; the nodding crown  
Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honours down.  
To their united force it yields, tho’ late,  
And mourns with mortal groans th’ approaching fate:  
The roots no more their upper load sustain;  
But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro’ the plain. </pre></div> </div>
