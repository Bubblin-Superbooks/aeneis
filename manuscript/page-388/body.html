Infold nine acres of infernal space.  
A rav’nous vulture, in his open’d side,  
Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;  
Still for the growing liver digg’d his breast;  
The growing liver still supplied the feast;  
Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:  
Th’ immortal hunger lasts, th’ immortal food remains.  
Ixion and Perithous I could name,  
And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.  
High o’er their heads a mould’ring rock is plac’d,  
That promises a fall, and shakes at ev’ry blast.  
They lie below, on golden beds display’d;  
And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.  
The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,  
And snatches from their mouths th’ untasted meat,  
Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,  
Tossing her torch, and thund’ring in their ears. </pre></div> </div>
