Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,  
Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:  
The god himself with ready trident stands,  
And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;  
Then heaves them off the shoals. Where’er he guides  
His finny coursers and in triumph rides,  
The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.  
As, when in tumults rise th’ ignoble crowd,  
Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;  
And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,  
And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:  
If then some grave and pious man appear,  
They hush their noise, and lend a list’ning ear;  
He soothes with sober words their angry mood,  
And quenches their innate desire of blood:  
So, when the Father of the Flood appears,  
And o’er the seas his sov’reign trident rears, </pre></div> </div>
