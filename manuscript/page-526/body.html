Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent  
Their crown, and ev’ry regal ornament:  
The people join their own with his desire;  
And all my conduct, as their king, require.  
But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,  
And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,  
And a soul conscious of its own decay,  
Have forc’d me to refuse imperial sway.  
My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,  
And should, but he’s a Sabine mother’s son,  
And half a native; but, in you, combine  
A manly vigour, and a foreign line.  
Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,  
Pursue the ready path to sov’reign sway.  
The staff of my declining days, my son,  
Shall make your good or ill success his own;  
In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, </pre></div> </div>
