Reclin’d upon my breast, thy grief unload:  
Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?  
Now all things to their utmost issue tend,  
Push’d by the Fates to their appointed end.  
While leave was giv’n thee, and a lawful hour  
For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow’r,  
Toss’d on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,  
And, driv’n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;  
Deform the royal house; and, from the side  
Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:  
Now cease at my command.” The Thund’rer said;  
And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:  
“Because your dread decree too well I knew,  
From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.  
Else should you not behold me here, alone,  
Involv’d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,  
But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight </pre></div> </div>
