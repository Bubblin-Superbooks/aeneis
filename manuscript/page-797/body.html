To mark his lineage from the God of Day.  
Two snowy coursers Turnus’ chariot yoke,  
And in his hand two massy spears he shook:  
Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,  
Aeneas, author of the Roman line;  
And by his side Ascanius took his place,  
The second hope of Rome’s immortal race.  
Adorn’d in white, a rev’rend priest appears,  
And off’rings to the flaming altars bears;  
A porket, and a lamb that never suffer’d shears.  
Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,  
And strews the beasts, design’d for sacrifice,  
With salt and meal: with like officious care  
He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.  
Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;  
With the same gen’rous juice the flame he feeds. </pre></div> </div>
