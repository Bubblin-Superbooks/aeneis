The jars of gen’rous wine (Acestes’ gift,  
When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)  
He set abroach, and for the feast prepar’d,  
In equal portions with the ven’son shar’d.  
Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief  
With cheerful words allay’d the common grief:  
“Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose  
To future good our past and present woes.  
With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;  
Th’ inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.  
What greater ills hereafter can you bear?  
Resume your courage and dismiss your care,  
An hour will come, with pleasure to relate  
Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.  
Thro’ various hazards and events, we move  
To Latium and the realms foredoom’d by Jove.  
Call’d to the seat (the promise of the skies) </pre></div> </div>
