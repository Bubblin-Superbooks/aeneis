Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,  
His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish’d eyes.  
From that auspicious day, with rites divine,  
We worship at the hero’s holy shrine.  
Potitius first ordain’d these annual vows:  
As priests, were added the Pinarian house,  
Who rais’d this altar in the sacred shade,  
Where honours, ever due, for ever shall be paid.  
For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,  
Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:  
Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,  
And with deep draughts invoke our common god.”  

This said, a double wreath Evander twin’d,  
And poplars black and white his temples bind.  
Then brims his ample bowl. With like design </pre></div> </div>
