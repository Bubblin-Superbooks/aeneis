Following with ease, if favour’d by thy fate,  
Thou art foredoom’d to view the Stygian state:  
If not, no labour can the tree constrain;  
And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.  
Besides, you know not, while you here attend,  
Th’ unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:  
Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,  
Depriv’d of fun’ral rites, pollutes your host.  
Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,  
Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;  
Then, living turfs upon his body lay:  
This done, securely take the destin’d way,  
To find the regions destitute of day.”  

She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went  
Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,  
Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. </pre></div> </div>
