As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,  
He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;  
But, if the pointed jav’lin pierce his side,  
The lordly beast returns with double pride:  
He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;  
His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:  
So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,  
Thro’ his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.  

Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,  
At length approach’d the king, and thus began:  
“No more excuses or delays: I stand  
In arms prepar’d to combat, hand to hand,  
This base deserter of his native land.  
The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take  
The same conditions which himself did make. </pre></div> </div>
