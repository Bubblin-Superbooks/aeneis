Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;  
A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,  
Like that of swans remurm’ring to the floods,  
Or birds of diff’ring kinds in hollow woods.  

Turnus th’ occasion takes, and cries aloud:  
“Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:  
Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,  
And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.”  
He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,  
Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:  
“Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command  
To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.  
Messapus and Catillus, post your force  
Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.  
Some guard the passes, others man the wall;  
Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.” </pre></div> </div>
