Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,  
Things which perhaps may grate a lover’s ear,  
But sound advice, proceeding from a heart  
Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.  
The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,  
No prince Italian born should heir my throne:  
Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill’d,  
And oft our priests, a foreign son reveal’d.  
Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,  
Brib’d by my kindness to my kindred blood,  
Urg’d by my wife, who would not be denied,  
I promis’d my Lavinia for your bride:  
Her from her plighted lord by force I took;  
All ties of treaties, and of honour, broke:  
On your account I wag’d an impious war—  
With what success, ’tis needless to declare;  
I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share. </pre></div> </div>
