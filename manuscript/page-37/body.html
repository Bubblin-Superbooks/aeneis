And true Achates on his steps attends.  
Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,  
Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:  
A huntress in her habit and her mien;  
Her dress a maid, her air confess’d a queen.  
Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;  
Loose was her hair, and wanton’d in the wind;  
Her hand sustain’d a bow; her quiver hung behind.  
She seem’d a virgin of the Spartan blood:  
With such array Harpalyce bestrode  
Her Thracian courser and outstripp’d the rapid flood.  
“Ho, strangers! have you lately seen,” she said,  
“One of my sisters, like myself array’d,  
Who cross’d the lawn, or in the forest stray’d?  
A painted quiver at her back she bore;  
Varied with spots, a lynx’s hide she wore;  
And at full cry pursued the tusky boar.” </pre></div> </div>
