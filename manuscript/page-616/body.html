At Aeneas’ return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode.</p><pre class="  "><code>The gates of heav’n unfold: Jove summons all  
The gods to council in the common hall.  
Sublimely seated, he surveys from far  
The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war,  
And all th’ inferior world. From first to last,  
The sov’reign senate in degrees are plac’d. </pre></div> </div>
