The ghosts repine at violated night,  
And curse th’ invading sun, and sicken at the sight.

Inclos’d, and in despair to fly away,  
Howls horrible from underneath, and fills  
His hollow palace with unmanly yells.

Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.

Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father’s fires, </pre></div> </div>
