But thought itself is by thy praise oppress’d.  
Yet rob me not of all; but let me join  
My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.  
The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill’d,  
Sends his light horse before to scour the field:  
Himself, thro’ steep ascents and thorny brakes,  
A larger compass to the city takes.  
This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare  
To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;  
With chosen foot his passage to forelay,  
And place an ambush in the winding way.  
Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;  
The brave Messapus shall thy troops enforce  
With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,  
Subjected all to thy supreme command.”  
This said, he warns Messapus to the war,  
Then ev’ry chief exhorts with equal care. </pre></div> </div>
