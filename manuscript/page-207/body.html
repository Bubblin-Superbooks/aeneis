To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject,  
With all the Libyan lords of mighty name;  
But will you fight against a pleasing flame!  
This little spot of land, which Heav’n bestows,  
On ev’ry side is hemm’d with warlike foes;  
Gaetulian cities here are spread around,  
And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound;  
Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land,  
And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand;  
Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore,  
And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more.  
Propitious Heav’n, and gracious Juno, lead  
This wand’ring navy to your needful aid:  
How will your empire spread, your city rise,  
From such a union, and with such allies?  
Implore the favour of the pow’rs above,  
And leave the conduct of the rest to love. </pre></div> </div>
