‘With these,’ said she, ‘these wand’ring ships destroy:  
These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.’  
Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:  
Slack not the good presage, while Heav’n inspires  
Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.  
See! Neptune’s altars minister their brands:  
The god is pleas’d; the god supplies our hands.”  
Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,  
And, toss’d in air, amidst the galleys threw.  

Wrapp’d in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:  
Then Pyrgo, reverenc’d for her hoary hair,  
Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam’s num’rous race:  
“No Beroe this, tho’ she belies her face!  
What terrors from her frowning front arise!  
Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!  
What rays around her heav’nly face are seen! </pre></div> </div>
