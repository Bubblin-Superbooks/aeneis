As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,  
The plowman, passenger, and lab’ring hind  
For shelter to the neighb’ring covert fly,  
Or hous’d, or safe in hollow caverns lie;  
But, that o’erblown, when heav’n above ’em smiles,  
Return to travel, and renew their toils:  
Aeneas thus, o’erwhelmed on ev’ry side,  
The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;  
And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat’ning cried:  
“Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage  
In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,  
Betray’d by pious love?” Nor, thus forborne,  
The youth desists, but with insulting scorn  
Provokes the ling’ring prince, whose patience, tir’d,  
Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir’d. </pre></div> </div>
