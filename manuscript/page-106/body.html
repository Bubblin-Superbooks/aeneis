Despair of life the means of living shows.’  
So bold a speech incourag’d their desire  
Of death, and added fuel to their fire.  

“As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,  
Scour thro’ the fields, nor fear the stormy night;  
Their whelps at home expect the promis’d food,  
And long to temper their dry chaps in blood:  
So rush’d we forth at once; resolv’d to die,  
Resolv’d, in death, the last extremes to try.  
We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare  
Th’ unequal combat in the public square:  
Night was our friend; our leader was despair.  
What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?  
What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?  
An ancient and imperial city falls:  
The streets are fill’d with frequent funerals; </pre></div> </div>
