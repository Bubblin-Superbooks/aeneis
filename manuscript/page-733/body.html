But, with a father’s right, bestow your own.  
For this maligner of the general good,  
If still we fear his force, he must be woo’d;  
His haughty godhead we with pray’rs implore,  
Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore.  
O cursed cause of all our ills, must we  
Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!  
What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,  
And send us out to meet our certain fate?  
’Tis a destructive war: from Turnus’ hand  
Our peace and public safety we demand.  
Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;  
If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.  
Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,  
Nor will I much with your belief contend:  
I beg your greatness not to give the law  
In others’ realms, but, beaten, to withdraw. </pre></div> </div>
