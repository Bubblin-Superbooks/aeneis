Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,  
They run around, or labour on their wings,  
Disus’d to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;  
To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try;  
Black vapours, issuing from the vent, involve the sky.  

But fate and envious fortune now prepare  
To plunge the Latins in the last despair.  
The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,  
And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,  
Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear—  
No troops of Turnus in the field appear.  
Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,  
And then concludes the royal youth is slain.  
Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear  
The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.  
She calls herself the cause of all this ill, </pre></div> </div>
